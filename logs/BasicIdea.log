by Josef Essberger

The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual. That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement, but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris.

Yet there was clearly something strange about the case. It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification, for it was fully clothed and none of the owner's personal effects had been removed, save of course for his head. The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man's wallet with forensic evidence from the body. Added to that, Madame Charente, the dead man's wife, could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways. (She had already reported her husband as missing.)

A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm, dark tunnels on either side of Odéon station, where the body had been found. Above ground another search was made, equally fruitlessly, and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved.

Two weeks later, four kilometres away in the west, a headless body was found at Courcelles station, again in the tunnel not far from the platform. As in the earlier case, the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head, which appeared to have been done with some precision. Again, the body was fully clothed and easily identified, and nothing but the head had apparently been removed.

"What can I tell these blessed reporters?" Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home. "They want answers for everything. And it's not just the papers now, the politicians are getting worried too. I'm reporting to the Préfet on this one."

"If there were instant answers for everything, mon petit chou, they'd have no need of you," said Madame Dutruelle. "And where would they be without you? Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year, and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot?"

The little inspecteur divisionnaire-chef pulled in his stomach, puffed out his chest and rose to his full height. A smile spread across his round face. In his smart dark suit and gold-rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris's most successful policemen.

"Just think," he said wryly, "they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation."

"They're fools, all of them."

"All the same, my dear, I don't know where to go on this one. There're no leads. There's no apparent motive. And it's a bizarre pattern. Assuming, of course, it is a pattern. We can't be sure of that until there's been another."

Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge. A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed.

"It's another one, sir," said the voice at the other end.

"Another what?"

"It's identical. Another headless corpse, just like the others - male, middle-aged, white."

"Where?" asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette.

"Château Rouge."

"In the Metro?"

"Yes sir, just inside the tunnel. In the anti-suicide well between the tracks."

"Close the line - if you haven't already. I'll be with you soon. And don't move it, d'you hear?"

Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room.

"I hate these early morning cases," he muttered. He lit his cigarette.

"Have a coffee before you go. Another dead body will keep."

"But we've closed the line. And it's the other side of town, my dear. North Paris."

"All the same."

He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee. Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty-six whose long, thin-lipped face was framed by stern grey hair. Her strong, practical hands were country hands, and she had never got used to city life. She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyrenées. Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again. Poor Agnes. She tried so hard to please him. How could she know that he longed to be free of her? How could she possibly know of Vololona, the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case? For him it had been love at first sight.

"And for me too, my darling," Vololona had been quick to agree, her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked, "a veritable coup de foudre." She spoke French well, with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise. Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man; but he was careful to tell no-one except Monsieur Chébaut, his closest friend, about the source of his happiness.

"I've never felt like this before, Pierre. I'm captivated by her," he said one evening when he took Monsieur Chébaut to see Vololona dancing.

It was a rare experience, even for the jaded Monsieur Chébaut. In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar. Her black limbs lashed the air to the music, which was raw and sensual.

"You know, Pierre, in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful. Well, you know that already. There was always my work, and the children, and I was happy enough at home. It never occured to me to look at another woman. But something happened when I met Vololona. She showed me how to live. She showed me what real ecstasy is. Look at her, Pierre. Isn't she the most exquisite thing you ever saw? And she adores me. She's crazy about me. But why, I ask you? What can she see in me - three times her age, pot-bellied, bald . . . married?"

Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows. He smiled proudly to himself. He knew exactly what was on their minds. Life was strange, he thought, and you could never tell. Some of them were young men, tall and handsome and virile, yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her.

Monsieur Chébaut finished his whisky.

"I can see," he said, "that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris." Monsieur Chébaut was a lawyer.

"You're a cynic, Pierre."

"And after thirty years in the force you're not?"

"Personally, I believe her when she says she loves me. I just don't know why. Another whisky?"

"Well, one thing's for sure, Régis, it can't go on like that. One way or another things'll come to a head. But I must agree, she's exquisite all right. Like an exquisite Venus fly-trap. And at the germane moment, you know, those soft, succulent petals will close around you like a vice."

The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend's unreasonable attitude.

"How can you say that?" he snapped. "When you haven't even spoken to her."

"But all women are the same, Régis. Don't you know that? You should be a lawyer, then you'd know it. They can't help it, they're built that way. Believe me, it can't go on without something happening."

Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing. Monsieur Chébaut could see he had touched a raw nerve. He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder.

"Look Régis, all I'm saying is, be careful, you haven't got my experience."

Of course, that was true. When it came to women few men had Monsieur Chébaut's experience. Or his luck, for that matter. He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties. He crossed roads without looking. He did not hurry for trains. He never reconciled bank accounts. Tall, slim, with boyish good looks and thick, black, wavy hair, he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle.

"Look, you've got two women involved, Régis," Monsieur Chébaut continued, "and women aren't like us. Agnes isn't stupid. She must know something's going on."

"She hasn't said anything," said the Inspector brusquely. He lit another Gauloise.

"Of course she hasn't. She's cleverer than you are. She intends to keep you."

"Mind you," said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly, "she has had some odd dreams recently - so she says. About me and another woman. But anyway, she just laughs and says she can't believe it."

"But Régis, you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same."

"Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something, if only out of decency."

Monsieur Chébaut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips.

"No," he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector, "never, you must never tell her. Écoute Régis, even if she did mention it, you must deny everything. Even if she caught the two of you in the act, you must deny it. You can only tell a woman there's another when you've definitively made up your mind to leave her, and even then it may not be safe."

"So much for logic."

"It's no use looking for logic in women, Régis. I told you, they're not like men. In fact, I've come to the conclusion that they're not even the same species as men. Men and women aren't like dog and bitch, they're more like dog and cat. C'est bizarre, non? In any case, I do know you can't keep two women on the go without something happening. I don't know what, but something."

Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Préfecture de police. Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings, and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them. They wanted constantly to know more. So of course did Inspector Dutruelle.

"I assure you, gentlemen," he told a press conference, "we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts. We are doing everything possible. You can tell your readers that wherever they are, we'll find them."

"Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers?" asked one of the foreign reporters.

"So as we know which heads we're looking for," added a journalist from London.

It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris. Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated. Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations. Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances. Even the beggars, who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages, had gone. And the few passengers who remained sat more long-faced than ever, or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms.

Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up. His mind, already excited over Vololona, was now in a turmoil. Vololona had suddenly, and tearfully, announced that she was pregnant. Then, having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy - but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic - she told him one day on the telephone: "I thought you were going to ask me to marry you." Inspector Dutruelle was stunned.

"But you know I'm married, ma chérie," he said.

"I thought you'd leave Agnes," she replied. "I wanted to be with you. I wanted to share everything with you . . . my child . . . my life . . . my bed." Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing.

"But darling, we can still see each other."

"No, it's too painful. I love you too much."

Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all. Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona; he longed to be with her. If only Agnes would leave him. And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already - the dinners, the presents, the apartment. Why did women have to possess you? It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took, until there was nothing left to give but yourself. Perhaps Pierre was right after all, when you thought about it.

The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally. Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect, no leads, no motive. His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity. "It appears," commented France-Soir, "that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer." The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector, and they felt leaderless and demoralised. It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact: that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common - their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart, and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them.

Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport, and he especially did not like the Metro. It was cramped, smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times, and in the summer it was hot. You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station. It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro.

"I can't take much more of this, Marc" he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him, "it's too hot. We'll get off at the next stop."

"That's Barbes Rochechouart, sir. We can change there."

"No, Marc. We can get out there. Someone else can take a sauna, I've had enough. Anyway, we need to have a look around." Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow. He sounded irritable. "God knows what it's like normally," he added.

When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart.

"At least we can get through now," said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator.

"How d'you mean?" asked Inspector Dutruelle.

"Well, normally this station's packed - beggars, passengers, buskers, hawkers, plus all their tables and stalls. It's like a damn great fair and market rolled into one. You can get anything here, from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes - not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin."

"Oh, yes," said Inspector Dutruelle, vaguely. "I remember." He passed a handkerchief across his brow again.

At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle's hand. Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight, the Inspector read aloud: "'Professor Dhiakobli, Grand Médium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life . . .'"

He broke off in mid-sentence with a snort.

"What a lot of mumbo-jumbo! Headless chickens and voodoo magic."

"It may be mumbo-jumbo to you, sir," said the Detective Constable with a laugh, "but round here they take that sort of thing seriously. And not only round here - after all, we use some of these techniques in the police, don't we?"

"Oh really? Such as?"

"Well, graphology for a start - you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone's handwriting scientific, can you sir? Or what about astrology - employing people on the basis of the stars? Or numerology."

"Yes, Marc," said Inspector Dutruelle, pushing the card into his top pocket, "maybe you're right, and maybe when you're older you won't be so sure. Now get on the blower and call the car."

The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August. No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro, and the media, bored with the lack of developments, left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity. Paris, deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast, was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro. Then, in September, the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal.

But Inspector Dutruelle's passion for Vololona did not cool with the season. Vololona had at last agreed to see him, occasionally; but she always managed (with tears in her eyes) to deflect his more amorous advances. For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment, but he was growing increasingly frustrated. The notion that she had another lover obsessed him, and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin. Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door, as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees. Now, denied the one thing here he wanted, the scene filled him with dismay. Money and music were in the air. Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways. Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini-skirts hurried to work. Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon-lit video clubs. Somewhere deep below ran the Metro; but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that. His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things. Sometimes he would stay all night, leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night's revelries. Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes, but he never once saw her on the arm of another man, or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor.

One night, late in October, he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight. Madame Dutruelle, having been told that her husband was working on a case, and perhaps believing it, was already asleep. Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair, for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes, the sort of man who irons his shoelaces. But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor. Muttering to himself, the Inspector bent and picked it up, and as he did so something fell from the top pocket. He gazed at it blankly for a moment. Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station, a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners, but still legible. He picked it up and slowly started to read:

PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI
Grand Médium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life: luck, love, marriage, attraction of clients, examinations, sexual potency. If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another, this is his domain, you will be loved and your partner will return. Prof. Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog. He will create between you a perfect rapport on the basis of love. All problems resolved, even desperate cases. Every day from 9am to 9pm. Payment after results.
13b, rue Beldamme, 75018 Paris
staircase B, 6th floor, door on left
Metro: Barbes Rochechouart

Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again. "All problems resolved . . ." It was preposterous. And yet, it was tempting. What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed? After all, everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it.

Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris's eighteenth arrondissement, an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa. It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart. Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way, cursing because he had not brought his umbrella. The door to number 13b was swinging in the wind, its dark paint peeling badly. He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth-floor door on which a brass plaque read: "Professor Dhiakobli Spécialiste des travaux occultes Please ring". He stood there, breathing heavily from the stairs, and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared.

"Please enter, my dear sir," said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy. "I am Dhiakobli. And I have the honour to meet . . . ?"

As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined, Professor Dhiakobli was black. He had a short yet commanding figure, and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit. A large, silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket.

"For the moment," said Inspector Dutruelle, "my name is hardly important. I've only come in response to your advertisement."

"Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help? A minor indiscretion? Please be seated, sir, and let us talk about the matter."

Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large, well upholstered chair to which he had been directed. Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk, on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging, its wide, moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer.

"Ah, I see that Zeus approves of you," said the Professor, stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers, his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle. "Poor Zeus, mon petit papillon, he is devoted to me, but he must remain here whenever I leave France. And you are fortunate, monsieur. It is only now that I return from Côte d'Ivoire. It is my country you know, I return there for a few months each summer. Paris in summer is so disagreeable, don't you agree?"

Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success. The frames of his glasses, the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left, the gem-studded rings on his fingers - all were of gold. From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man. Around him the large room was like a shrine. Heavy curtains excluded the daylight (the only illumination was a small brass desklamp) and the dark, red walls were festooned with spears, costumes, photographs and other African memorabilia. There was a sweet smell in the air, and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator. You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris.

"As I say," began Inspector Dutruelle, ignoring the Professor's question, "I saw your card and I wondered just how you work."

"And may one enquire as to monsieur's little difficulty?"

Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could.

"Well," - he coughed again - "first of all, I wondered what sort of things you can help people with."

The Professor's eyebrows rose.

"Anything," he said slowly, his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin. "My dear sir, anything at all."

"And then, I wondered, how do you operate? That's to say, what exactly do you do . . . and how do you charge?"

"Ah monsieur, let us not talk of money. First I must learn just how I can help you. And for that a consultation is in order."

Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat.

"And what would a consultation involve? What does it . . . cost?"

Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably.

"Mon cher monsieur, I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money. I too recoil at the mere thought of it. It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune. And if some donate a small token of their gratitude, who am I to refuse their offering? They pay according to their means, to assist those who have little to offer. But for a preliminary consultation, monsieur, a nominal sum, as a mark of good faith, is usually in order. For a gentleman of your obvious standing, a trifle, a mere two hundred francs. And let me assure you, monsieur, of my absolute discretion. Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls." He paused. Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin: "They have the sanctity of the confessional."

"I'm glad to hear it," said the Inspector.

"But monsieur still has the advantage of me . . ." continued Professor Dhiakobli.

Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking. He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier, a Parisien wine merchant, and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul. He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients; of their instant and passionate love for one another; of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him; and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave. Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits' end and now even his business was suffering. He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret. The Professor listened intently, asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments. Finally Inspector Dutruelle said: "Well, Professor Dhiakobli, I think that's all I can tell you. I don't think I can tell you any more. From what I have told you, do you believe you can help me?"

For a long time there was silence. The Professor appeared to be in another world. He stared at Inspector Dutruelle, but seemed to be looking through him.

"My dear Monsieur Mazodier," he said at last, very slowly, almost mechanically, "the story you have told me is most poignant. Each of us has a hidden corner in his life, a jardin secret. Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours. Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women. At the mercy of their complex physical structure, is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures? I help them find their lost ones, their partners of many years, to recreate again the rapport of their youth. You will understand that it is not easy. But this is my work. My domain."

"So you can't help me?" said Inspector Dutruelle, adding despondently: "Perhaps what I really need is a head-shrink."

The Professor gave a start. Again, for a long time he did not answer. Then his teeth flashed in the dimness.

"Écoutez monsieur, this is my work, my domain," he repeated. "Certainly I can help you. But you must understand that it will not be easy. It calls for a special ceremony. In the first place, you are married, and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women. In the second, we are both men of the world, monsieur, and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages. And finally, it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic. You know, the magic of Madagascar is very strong. No, monsieur, it will not be easy. Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone. Sometimes . . ." He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye, his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant. "Sometimes," he said, "we must make sacrifices."

"What sort of sacrifices?" asked Inspector Dutruelle dully.

"Oh, my dear sir, you must leave that to me. But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs." His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath. "You must not concern yourself with technicalities, monsieur. Your mind must be fixed on the future, on the life you have dreamed of. You must envisage your wife - happy in the arms of another. You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for . . . secure in your arms . . . sharing your life . . . your days . . . your nights. The perfect solution to all your problems. Is it not worth a considerable sum?"

"It certainly would be worth a lot . . ." Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor's words came to life in his mind.

"Shall we say thirty thousand francs?"

"I'm sorry?" muttered the Inspector.

"Let's say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards," the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken. "Do you see, monsieur, how confident I am of success?"

Inspector Dutruelle did not reply. He was confused. He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt, or to propose quite so generous a token. But it did not seem to matter. After all, what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately? And, in any case, at worst it was only fifteen thousand.

The Professor's eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle.

"Of course, monsieur, I have faith in your gratitude. I know that you will not forget, in your delight, that what I have done, I can undo. And now, monsieur, you must not allow me to detain you further. We have much work to do. In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy. And with some little articles of clothing, something close to their thoughts, say a scarf or a hat. You can arrange this?"

Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly.

"Excellent, monsieur. I must know them in every detail - if I am to have a spiritual tête-à-tête with each of them. So, in fifteen days, you will return for the ceremony. It will take place beyond those curtains, in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits. Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there, but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day. It must be at dawn, and you must come without fail - the ceremony cannot be deferred. Can you manage six in the morning, shall we say Monday the sixteenth?"

Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December. At four o'clock in the morning he got out of bed. Though his wife stirred she did not wake. He showered and dressed. His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen, boiling water for his coffee. He drank two cups, strong and black, but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam. He lit a Gauloise and paced the room. Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing, finishing his cigarette. Below him the courtyard was dark and silent, and above him the sky was black. But away in the east, through the open end of the court, a violet hue was creeping over Paris. He glanced at his watch. It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car. It would seem strange, leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver. He wondered what the concierge would make of it all - she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor. He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut.

Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything. He looked into the bedroom. Gently, he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept, her arms clasped about her knees. He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek. Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him, switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen, and opened the front door. As he did so the telephone rang. It startled him and he cursed aloud. He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake.

"Inspector Dutruelle?" said the voice at the other end.

"Yes, what is it?"

"Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning, Monsieur l'Inspecteur. It's the Préfecture."

"Never mind the time," said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey. "I'm off duty today."

"Well, that's the point, Inspector. The Préfet's ordered us to call you specially. He appreciates you're not on duty, but he wants you anyway."

"It's quite impossible."

"I'm afraid he insists, sir."

"Why?"

"He insists you come on duty immediately, sir. We're sending a car round for you."

"Yes, yes, I understand, but why?"

"It's the Metro again, sir."

"The Metro?"

"Yes, sir. They've found another corpse on the line, decapitated again."

Inspector Dutruelle did not reply. He was cursing to himself. He was cursing the Préfet, the police, this homicidal maniac, his wife. Why today? Why ever today?

"Sir? Hello sir? The car'll be with you in five minutes."

"Yes, all right. I'll be ready in five minutes."

The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf. Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine. His dreams, it seemed, were evaporating just as surely.

"You'd better brief me on this as quick as you can," he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car. "Where was the body found?"

"Barbes Rochechouart, sir."

A cold shiver passed through the Inspector.

"I presume it's the same as the others?" he asked.

"Well, in as much as there's nothing to go on, it's the same, sir. Otherwise it couldn't be more different. For a start, we've just heard they've found two of them now. And this time they're women. One white, in her forties, and one black. A young black girl - still in her teens, by the look of things."

But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening. He was staring blankly through the glass to his right, and as they turned at Place du Châtelet the empty streets were no more than a cold, grey blur to him. The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de Sébastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart. It was the route he should have been taking in his own car.

Outside the station, now closed to passengers, people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up. Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car. He hesitated. He glanced towards Rue Beldamme (just a stone's throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart) where the Professor would be waiting for him. He shrugged and went down the station steps.

Underground, on the number four line, there was an air of gloom. Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train-drivers through that morning. Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one. It was the body of a middle-aged woman, quite unexceptional, coarse and wiry, like his wife.

"She's forty-seven, Monsieur l'Inspecteur," said somebody beside him. "French. Name of Madame Catherine Dubur. Not like the other one."

"The other one?" said the Inspector blankly.

"I told you in the car, sir," said the Detective Sergeant at his ear, "there's two of them."

"You'd better show me."

They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track. A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body, which lay on its back. Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff, black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines. Suddenly he shuddered in alarm. Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona.

"Identity?" he asked. He tried to control his voice.

"We don't know, sir - this is all we found," said a policeman, handing him a tattered greetings card. Inside, in large, green handwriting, were the words: "Happy Nineteenth Birthday, from Everyone in Antananarivo."

"D'you think she's Malagasy, sir?" asked the policeman. The Inspector shrugged his shoulders, then held out an open hand.

"Your torch, please," he said.

He played its beam over the body, up and down the long, slender legs, across the clothes. At least he did not recognise the clothes. Yet the body's size, its build, its colour, everything pointed to Vololona. He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him. He stood up in relief. That was certainly not Vololona. Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her - and the other of Agnes, for that matter. Even the ages were the same.

He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse. He could not understand. Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere? And what of Agnes? How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that? How could he explain it, when you came to think of it? When you came to think of it, he had explained very little. He had been happy enough to take the money, and free enough with his words - all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual tête-à-têtes . . .

Inspector Dutruelle gasped.

"The devil," he muttered to himself. Suddenly he understood everything.

"The what, sir?" said somebody beside him.

"Never mind," he answered quietly, putting his hand to his breast pocket. His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions. He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise. Through its curling blue smoke, back-lit by the lights of the train, the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance, while beside him men's voices were thrumming in his ear. Why was there no time to think, to extricate himself from this nightmare? He cursed himself. How could he have been so stupid? He cursed his wife and Vololona. And Professor Dhiakobli. What madness had driven him to this? Then he cursed himself again, and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side.

"What time is it?"

"Six-fifteen, sir."

For a moment, he hesitated. Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body.

"Écoute Guy, when he's got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up," he said. "Now get me the Préfet."

The Préfet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep, and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation.

"Are you insane, man? You're in the middle of an investigation!"

"The investigation is over, Monsieur le Préfet."

"So, you have the killer at last!"

"In fifteen minutes, monsieur, in fifteen minutes."

"Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty?"

2014-07-04 22:03:16 INFO  WordsCounter:19 - Text after regex, before split(space) :  The Metro  by Josef Essberger  The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual  That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement  but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris   Yet there was clearly something strange about the case  It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification  for it was fully clothed and none of the owner s personal effects had been removed  save of course for his head  The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man s wallet with forensic evidence from the body  Added to that  Madame Charente  the dead man s wife  could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways   She had already reported her husband as missing    A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm  dark tunnels on either side of Od on station  where the body had been found  Above ground another search was made  equally fruitlessly  and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved   Two weeks later  four kilometres away in the west  a headless body was found at Courcelles station  again in the tunnel not far from the platform  As in the earlier case  the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head  which appeared to have been done with some precision  Again  the body was fully clothed and easily identified  and nothing but the head had apparently been removed    What can I tell these blessed reporters   Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home   They want answers for everything  And it s not just the papers now  the politicians are getting worried too  I m reporting to the Pr fet on this one     If there were instant answers for everything  mon petit chou  they d have no need of you   said Madame Dutruelle   And where would they be without you  Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year  and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot    The little inspecteur divisionnaire chef pulled in his stomach  puffed out his chest and rose to his full height  A smile spread across his round face  In his smart dark suit and gold rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris s most successful policemen    Just think   he said wryly   they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation     They re fools  all of them     All the same  my dear  I don t know where to go on this one  There re no leads  There s no apparent motive  And it s a bizarre pattern  Assuming  of course  it is a pattern  We can t be sure of that until there s been another    Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge  A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed    It s another one  sir   said the voice at the other end    Another what     It s identical  Another headless corpse  just like the others   male  middle aged  white     Where   asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette    Ch teau Rouge     In the Metro     Yes sir  just inside the tunnel  In the anti suicide well between the tracks     Close the line   if you haven t already  I ll be with you soon  And don t move it  d you hear    Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room    I hate these early morning cases   he muttered  He lit his cigarette    Have a coffee before you go  Another dead body will keep     But we ve closed the line  And it s the other side of town  my dear  North Paris     All the same    He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee  Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty six whose long  thin lipped face was framed by stern grey hair  Her strong  practical hands were country hands  and she had never got used to city life  She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyren es  Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again  Poor Agnes  She tried so hard to please him  How could she know that he longed to be free of her  How could she possibly know of Vololona  the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case  For him it had been love at first sight    And for me too  my darling   Vololona had been quick to agree  her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked   a veritable coup de foudre   She spoke French well  with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise  Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man  but he was careful to tell no one except Monsieur Ch baut  his closest friend  about the source of his happiness    I ve never felt like this before  Pierre  I m captivated by her   he said one evening when he took Monsieur Ch baut to see Vololona dancing   It was a rare experience  even for the jaded Monsieur Ch baut  In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar  Her black limbs lashed the air to the music  which was raw and sensual    You know  Pierre  in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful  Well  you know that already  There was always my work  and the children  and I was happy enough at home  It never occured to me to look at another woman  But something happened when I met Vololona  She showed me how to live  She showed me what real ecstasy is  Look at her  Pierre  Isn t she the most exquisite thing you ever saw  And she adores me  She s crazy about me  But why  I ask you  What can she see in me   three times her age  pot bellied  bald       married    Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows  He smiled proudly to himself  He knew exactly what was on their minds  Life was strange  he thought  and you could never tell  Some of them were young men  tall and handsome and virile  yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her   Monsieur Ch baut finished his whisky    I can see   he said   that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris   Monsieur Ch baut was a lawyer    You re a cynic  Pierre     And after thirty years in the force you re not     Personally  I believe her when she says she loves me  I just don t know why  Another whisky     Well  one thing s for sure  R gis  it can t go on like that  One way or another things ll come to a head  But I must agree  she s exquisite all right  Like an exquisite Venus fly trap  And at the germane moment  you know  those soft  succulent petals will close around you like a vice    The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend s unreasonable attitude    How can you say that   he snapped   When you haven t even spoken to her     But all women are the same  R gis  Don t you know that  You should be a lawyer  then you d know it  They can t help it  they re built that way  Believe me  it can t go on without something happening    Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing  Monsieur Ch baut could see he had touched a raw nerve  He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder    Look R gis  all I m saying is  be careful  you haven t got my experience    Of course  that was true  When it came to women few men had Monsieur Ch baut s experience  Or his luck  for that matter  He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties  He crossed roads without looking  He did not hurry for trains  He never reconciled bank accounts  Tall  slim  with boyish good looks and thick  black  wavy hair  he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle    Look  you ve got two women involved  R gis   Monsieur Ch baut continued   and women aren t like us  Agnes isn t stupid  She must know something s going on     She hasn t said anything   said the Inspector brusquely  He lit another Gauloise    Of course she hasn t  She s cleverer than you are  She intends to keep you     Mind you   said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly   she has had some odd dreams recently   so she says  About me and another woman  But anyway  she just laughs and says she can t believe it     But R gis  you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same     Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something  if only out of decency    Monsieur Ch baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips    No   he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector   never  you must never tell her   coute R gis  even if she did mention it  you must deny everything  Even if she caught the two of you in the act  you must deny it  You can only tell a woman there s another when you ve definitively made up your mind to leave her  and even then it may not be safe     So much for logic     It s no use looking for logic in women  R gis  I told you  they re not like men  In fact  I ve come to the conclusion that they re not even the same species as men  Men and women aren t like dog and bitch  they re more like dog and cat  C est bizarre  non  In any case  I do know you can t keep two women on the go without something happening  I don t know what  but something    Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Pr fecture de police  Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings  and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them  They wanted constantly to know more  So of course did Inspector Dutruelle    I assure you  gentlemen   he told a press conference   we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts  We are doing everything possible  You can tell your readers that wherever they are  we ll find them     Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers   asked one of the foreign reporters    So as we know which heads we re looking for   added a journalist from London   It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris  Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated  Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations  Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances  Even the beggars  who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages  had gone  And the few passengers who remained sat more long faced than ever  or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms   Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up  His mind  already excited over Vololona  was now in a turmoil  Vololona had suddenly  and tearfully  announced that she was pregnant  Then  having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy   but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic   she told him one day on the telephone   I thought you were going to ask me to marry you   Inspector Dutruelle was stunned    But you know I m married  ma ch rie   he said    I thought you d leave Agnes   she replied   I wanted to be with you  I wanted to share everything with you       my child       my life       my bed   Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing    But darling  we can still see each other     No  it s too painful  I love you too much    Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all  Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona  he longed to be with her  If only Agnes would leave him  And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already   the dinners  the presents  the apartment  Why did women have to possess you  It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took  until there was nothing left to give but yourself  Perhaps Pierre was right after all  when you thought about it   The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally  Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect  no leads  no motive  His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity   It appears   commented France Soir   that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer   The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector  and they felt leaderless and demoralised  It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact  that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common   their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart  and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them   Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport  and he especially did not like the Metro  It was cramped  smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times  and in the summer it was hot  You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station  It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro    I can t take much more of this  Marc  he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him   it s too hot  We ll get off at the next stop     That s Barbes Rochechouart  sir  We can change there     No  Marc  We can get out there  Someone else can take a sauna  I ve had enough  Anyway  we need to have a look around   Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow  He sounded irritable   God knows what it s like normally   he added   When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart    At least we can get through now   said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator    How d you mean   asked Inspector Dutruelle    Well  normally this station s packed   beggars  passengers  buskers  hawkers  plus all their tables and stalls  It s like a damn great fair and market rolled into one  You can get anything here  from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes   not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin     Oh  yes   said Inspector Dutruelle  vaguely   I remember   He passed a handkerchief across his brow again   At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle s hand  Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight  the Inspector read aloud    Professor Dhiakobli  Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life          He broke off in mid sentence with a snort    What a lot of mumbo jumbo  Headless chickens and voodoo magic     It may be mumbo jumbo to you  sir   said the Detective Constable with a laugh   but round here they take that sort of thing seriously  And not only round here   after all  we use some of these techniques in the police  don t we     Oh really  Such as     Well  graphology for a start   you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone s handwriting scientific  can you sir  Or what about astrology   employing people on the basis of the stars  Or numerology     Yes  Marc   said Inspector Dutruelle  pushing the card into his top pocket   maybe you re right  and maybe when you re older you won t be so sure  Now get on the blower and call the car    The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August  No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro  and the media  bored with the lack of developments  left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity  Paris  deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast  was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro  Then  in September  the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal   But Inspector Dutruelle s passion for Vololona did not cool with the season  Vololona had at last agreed to see him  occasionally  but she always managed  with tears in her eyes  to deflect his more amorous advances  For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment  but he was growing increasingly frustrated  The notion that she had another lover obsessed him  and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin  Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door  as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees  Now  denied the one thing here he wanted  the scene filled him with dismay  Money and music were in the air  Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways  Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini skirts hurried to work  Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon lit video clubs  Somewhere deep below ran the Metro  but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that  His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things  Sometimes he would stay all night  leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night s revelries  Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes  but he never once saw her on the arm of another man  or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor   One night  late in October  he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight  Madame Dutruelle  having been told that her husband was working on a case  and perhaps believing it  was already asleep  Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair  for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes  the sort of man who irons his shoelaces  But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor  Muttering to himself  the Inspector bent and picked it up  and as he did so something fell from the top pocket  He gazed at it blankly for a moment  Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station  a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners  but still legible  He picked it up and slowly started to read   PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life  luck  love  marriage  attraction of clients  examinations  sexual potency  If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another  this is his domain  you will be loved and your partner will return  Prof  Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog  He will create between you a perfect rapport on the basis of love  All problems resolved  even desperate cases  Every day from  am to  pm  Payment after results    b  rue Beldamme        Paris staircase B   th floor  door on left Metro  Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again   All problems resolved        It was preposterous  And yet  it was tempting  What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed  After all  everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it   Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris s eighteenth arrondissement  an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa  It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way  cursing because he had not brought his umbrella  The door to number   b was swinging in the wind  its dark paint peeling badly  He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth floor door on which a brass plaque read   Professor Dhiakobli Sp cialiste des travaux occultes Please ring   He stood there  breathing heavily from the stairs  and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared    Please enter  my dear sir   said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy   I am Dhiakobli  And I have the honour to meet           As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined  Professor Dhiakobli was black  He had a short yet commanding figure  and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit  A large  silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket    For the moment   said Inspector Dutruelle   my name is hardly important  I ve only come in response to your advertisement     Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help  A minor indiscretion  Please be seated  sir  and let us talk about the matter    Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large  well upholstered chair to which he had been directed  Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk  on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging  its wide  moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer    Ah  I see that Zeus approves of you   said the Professor  stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers  his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle   Poor Zeus  mon petit papillon  he is devoted to me  but he must remain here whenever I leave France  And you are fortunate  monsieur  It is only now that I return from C te d Ivoire  It is my country you know  I return there for a few months each summer  Paris in summer is so disagreeable  don t you agree    Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success  The frames of his glasses  the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left  the gem studded rings on his fingers   all were of gold  From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man  Around him the large room was like a shrine  Heavy curtains excluded the daylight  the only illumination was a small brass desklamp  and the dark  red walls were festooned with spears  costumes  photographs and other African memorabilia  There was a sweet smell in the air  and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator  You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris    As I say   began Inspector Dutruelle  ignoring the Professor s question   I saw your card and I wondered just how you work     And may one enquire as to monsieur s little difficulty    Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could    Well     he coughed again    first of all  I wondered what sort of things you can help people with    The Professor s eyebrows rose    Anything   he said slowly  his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin   My dear sir  anything at all     And then  I wondered  how do you operate  That s to say  what exactly do you do       and how do you charge     Ah monsieur  let us not talk of money  First I must learn just how I can help you  And for that a consultation is in order    Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat    And what would a consultation involve  What does it       cost    Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably    Mon cher monsieur  I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money  I too recoil at the mere thought of it  It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune  And if some donate a small token of their gratitude  who am I to refuse their offering  They pay according to their means  to assist those who have little to offer  But for a preliminary consultation  monsieur  a nominal sum  as a mark of good faith  is usually in order  For a gentleman of your obvious standing  a trifle  a mere two hundred francs  And let me assure you  monsieur  of my absolute discretion  Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls   He paused  Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin   They have the sanctity of the confessional     I m glad to hear it   said the Inspector    But monsieur still has the advantage of me        continued Professor Dhiakobli   Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking  He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier  a Parisien wine merchant  and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul  He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients  of their instant and passionate love for one another  of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him  and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave  Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits  end and now even his business was suffering  He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret  The Professor listened intently  asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments  Finally Inspector Dutruelle said   Well  Professor Dhiakobli  I think that s all I can tell you  I don t think I can tell you any more  From what I have told you  do you believe you can help me    For a long time there was silence  The Professor appeared to be in another world  He stared at Inspector Dutruelle  but seemed to be looking through him    My dear Monsieur Mazodier   he said at last  very slowly  almost mechanically   the story you have told me is most poignant  Each of us has a hidden corner in his life  a jardin secret  Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours  Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women  At the mercy of their complex physical structure  is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures  I help them find their lost ones  their partners of many years  to recreate again the rapport of their youth  You will understand that it is not easy  But this is my work  My domain     So you can t help me   said Inspector Dutruelle  adding despondently   Perhaps what I really need is a head shrink    The Professor gave a start  Again  for a long time he did not answer  Then his teeth flashed in the dimness     coutez monsieur  this is my work  my domain   he repeated   Certainly I can help you  But you must understand that it will not be easy  It calls for a special ceremony  In the first place  you are married  and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women  In the second  we are both men of the world  monsieur  and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages  And finally  it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic  You know  the magic of Madagascar is very strong  No  monsieur  it will not be easy  Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone  Sometimes        He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye  his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant   Sometimes   he said   we must make sacrifices     What sort of sacrifices   asked Inspector Dutruelle dully    Oh  my dear sir  you must leave that to me  But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs   His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath   You must not concern yourself with technicalities  monsieur  Your mind must be fixed on the future  on the life you have dreamed of  You must envisage your wife   happy in the arms of another  You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for       secure in your arms       sharing your life       your days       your nights  The perfect solution to all your problems  Is it not worth a considerable sum     It certainly would be worth a lot        Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor s words came to life in his mind    Shall we say thirty thousand francs     I m sorry   muttered the Inspector    Let s say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards   the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken   Do you see  monsieur  how confident I am of success    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was confused  He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt  or to propose quite so generous a token  But it did not seem to matter  After all  what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately  And  in any case  at worst it was only fifteen thousand   The Professor s eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle    Of course  monsieur  I have faith in your gratitude  I know that you will not forget  in your delight  that what I have done  I can undo  And now  monsieur  you must not allow me to detain you further  We have much work to do  In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy  And with some little articles of clothing  something close to their thoughts  say a scarf or a hat  You can arrange this    Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly    Excellent  monsieur  I must know them in every detail   if I am to have a spiritual t te   t te with each of them  So  in fifteen days  you will return for the ceremony  It will take place beyond those curtains  in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits  Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there  but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day  It must be at dawn  and you must come without fail   the ceremony cannot be deferred  Can you manage six in the morning  shall we say Monday the sixteenth    Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December  At four o clock in the morning he got out of bed  Though his wife stirred she did not wake  He showered and dressed  His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen  boiling water for his coffee  He drank two cups  strong and black  but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam  He lit a Gauloise and paced the room  Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing  finishing his cigarette  Below him the courtyard was dark and silent  and above him the sky was black  But away in the east  through the open end of the court  a violet hue was creeping over Paris  He glanced at his watch  It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car  It would seem strange  leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver  He wondered what the concierge would make of it all   she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor  He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut   Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything  He looked into the bedroom  Gently  he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept  her arms clasped about her knees  He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek  Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him  switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen  and opened the front door  As he did so the telephone rang  It startled him and he cursed aloud  He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake    Inspector Dutruelle   said the voice at the other end    Yes  what is it     Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning  Monsieur l Inspecteur  It s the Pr fecture     Never mind the time   said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey   I m off duty today     Well  that s the point  Inspector  The Pr fet s ordered us to call you specially  He appreciates you re not on duty  but he wants you anyway     It s quite impossible     I m afraid he insists  sir     Why     He insists you come on duty immediately  sir  We re sending a car round for you     Yes  yes  I understand  but why     It s the Metro again  sir     The Metro     Yes  sir  They ve found another corpse on the line  decapitated again    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was cursing to himself  He was cursing the Pr fet  the police  this homicidal maniac  his wife  Why today  Why ever today    Sir  Hello sir  The car ll be with you in five minutes     Yes  all right  I ll be ready in five minutes    The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf  Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine  His dreams  it seemed  were evaporating just as surely    You d better brief me on this as quick as you can   he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car   Where was the body found     Barbes Rochechouart  sir    A cold shiver passed through the Inspector    I presume it s the same as the others   he asked    Well  in as much as there s nothing to go on  it s the same  sir  Otherwise it couldn t be more different  For a start  we ve just heard they ve found two of them now  And this time they re women  One white  in her forties  and one black  A young black girl   still in her teens  by the look of things    But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening  He was staring blankly through the glass to his right  and as they turned at Place du Ch telet the empty streets were no more than a cold  grey blur to him  The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de S bastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart  It was the route he should have been taking in his own car   Outside the station  now closed to passengers  people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up  Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car  He hesitated  He glanced towards Rue Beldamme  just a stone s throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart  where the Professor would be waiting for him  He shrugged and went down the station steps   Underground  on the number four line  there was an air of gloom  Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train drivers through that morning  Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one  It was the body of a middle aged woman  quite unexceptional  coarse and wiry  like his wife    She s forty seven  Monsieur l Inspecteur   said somebody beside him   French  Name of Madame Catherine Dubur  Not like the other one     The other one   said the Inspector blankly    I told you in the car  sir   said the Detective Sergeant at his ear   there s two of them     You d better show me    They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track  A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body  which lay on its back  Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff  black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines  Suddenly he shuddered in alarm  Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona    Identity   he asked  He tried to control his voice    We don t know  sir   this is all we found   said a policeman  handing him a tattered greetings card  Inside  in large  green handwriting  were the words   Happy Nineteenth Birthday  from Everyone in Antananarivo     D you think she s Malagasy  sir   asked the policeman  The Inspector shrugged his shoulders  then held out an open hand    Your torch  please   he said   He played its beam over the body  up and down the long  slender legs  across the clothes  At least he did not recognise the clothes  Yet the body s size  its build  its colour  everything pointed to Vololona  He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him  He stood up in relief  That was certainly not Vololona  Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her   and the other of Agnes  for that matter  Even the ages were the same   He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse  He could not understand  Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere  And what of Agnes  How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that  How could he explain it  when you came to think of it  When you came to think of it  he had explained very little  He had been happy enough to take the money  and free enough with his words   all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual t te   t tes        Inspector Dutruelle gasped    The devil   he muttered to himself  Suddenly he understood everything    The what  sir   said somebody beside him    Never mind   he answered quietly  putting his hand to his breast pocket  His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions  He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise  Through its curling blue smoke  back lit by the lights of the train  the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance  while beside him men s voices were thrumming in his ear  Why was there no time to think  to extricate himself from this nightmare  He cursed himself  How could he have been so stupid  He cursed his wife and Vololona  And Professor Dhiakobli  What madness had driven him to this  Then he cursed himself again  and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side    What time is it     Six fifteen  sir    For a moment  he hesitated  Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body     coute Guy  when he s got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up   he said   Now get me the Pr fet    The Pr fet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep  and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation    Are you insane  man  You re in the middle of an investigation     The investigation is over  Monsieur le Pr fet     So  you have the killer at last     In fifteen minutes  monsieur  in fifteen minutes     Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty
