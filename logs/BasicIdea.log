2014-07-05 17:32:22 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex The Metro  by Josef Essberger  The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual  That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement  but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris   Yet there was clearly something strange about the case  It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification  for it was fully clothed and none of the owner s personal effects had been removed  save of course for his head  The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man s wallet with forensic evidence from the body  Added to that  Madame Charente  the dead man s wife  could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways   She had already reported her husband as missing    A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm  dark tunnels on either side of Od on station  where the body had been found  Above ground another search was made  equally fruitlessly  and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved   Two weeks later  four kilometres away in the west  a headless body was found at Courcelles station  again in the tunnel not far from the platform  As in the earlier case  the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head  which appeared to have been done with some precision  Again  the body was fully clothed and easily identified  and nothing but the head had apparently been removed    What can I tell these blessed reporters   Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home   They want answers for everything  And it s not just the papers now  the politicians are getting worried too  I m reporting to the Pr fet on this one     If there were instant answers for everything  mon petit chou  they d have no need of you   said Madame Dutruelle   And where would they be without you  Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year  and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot    The little inspecteur divisionnaire chef pulled in his stomach  puffed out his chest and rose to his full height  A smile spread across his round face  In his smart dark suit and gold rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris s most successful policemen    Just think   he said wryly   they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation     They re fools  all of them     All the same  my dear  I don t know where to go on this one  There re no leads  There s no apparent motive  And it s a bizarre pattern  Assuming  of course  it is a pattern  We can t be sure of that until there s been another    Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge  A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed    It s another one  sir   said the voice at the other end    Another what     It s identical  Another headless corpse  just like the others   male  middle aged  white     Where   asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette    Ch teau Rouge     In the Metro     Yes sir  just inside the tunnel  In the anti suicide well between the tracks     Close the line   if you haven t already  I ll be with you soon  And don t move it  d you hear    Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room    I hate these early morning cases   he muttered  He lit his cigarette    Have a coffee before you go  Another dead body will keep     But we ve closed the line  And it s the other side of town  my dear  North Paris     All the same    He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee  Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty six whose long  thin lipped face was framed by stern grey hair  Her strong  practical hands were country hands  and she had never got used to city life  She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyren es  Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again  Poor Agnes  She tried so hard to please him  How could she know that he longed to be free of her  How could she possibly know of Vololona  the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case  For him it had been love at first sight    And for me too  my darling   Vololona had been quick to agree  her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked   a veritable coup de foudre   She spoke French well  with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise  Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man  but he was careful to tell no one except Monsieur Ch baut  his closest friend  about the source of his happiness    I ve never felt like this before  Pierre  I m captivated by her   he said one evening when he took Monsieur Ch baut to see Vololona dancing   It was a rare experience  even for the jaded Monsieur Ch baut  In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar  Her black limbs lashed the air to the music  which was raw and sensual    You know  Pierre  in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful  Well  you know that already  There was always my work  and the children  and I was happy enough at home  It never occured to me to look at another woman  But something happened when I met Vololona  She showed me how to live  She showed me what real ecstasy is  Look at her  Pierre  Isn t she the most exquisite thing you ever saw  And she adores me  She s crazy about me  But why  I ask you  What can she see in me   three times her age  pot bellied  bald       married    Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows  He smiled proudly to himself  He knew exactly what was on their minds  Life was strange  he thought  and you could never tell  Some of them were young men  tall and handsome and virile  yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her   Monsieur Ch baut finished his whisky    I can see   he said   that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris   Monsieur Ch baut was a lawyer    You re a cynic  Pierre     And after thirty years in the force you re not     Personally  I believe her when she says she loves me  I just don t know why  Another whisky     Well  one thing s for sure  R gis  it can t go on like that  One way or another things ll come to a head  But I must agree  she s exquisite all right  Like an exquisite Venus fly trap  And at the germane moment  you know  those soft  succulent petals will close around you like a vice    The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend s unreasonable attitude    How can you say that   he snapped   When you haven t even spoken to her     But all women are the same  R gis  Don t you know that  You should be a lawyer  then you d know it  They can t help it  they re built that way  Believe me  it can t go on without something happening    Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing  Monsieur Ch baut could see he had touched a raw nerve  He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder    Look R gis  all I m saying is  be careful  you haven t got my experience    Of course  that was true  When it came to women few men had Monsieur Ch baut s experience  Or his luck  for that matter  He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties  He crossed roads without looking  He did not hurry for trains  He never reconciled bank accounts  Tall  slim  with boyish good looks and thick  black  wavy hair  he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle    Look  you ve got two women involved  R gis   Monsieur Ch baut continued   and women aren t like us  Agnes isn t stupid  She must know something s going on     She hasn t said anything   said the Inspector brusquely  He lit another Gauloise    Of course she hasn t  She s cleverer than you are  She intends to keep you     Mind you   said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly   she has had some odd dreams recently   so she says  About me and another woman  But anyway  she just laughs and says she can t believe it     But R gis  you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same     Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something  if only out of decency    Monsieur Ch baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips    No   he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector   never  you must never tell her   coute R gis  even if she did mention it  you must deny everything  Even if she caught the two of you in the act  you must deny it  You can only tell a woman there s another when you ve definitively made up your mind to leave her  and even then it may not be safe     So much for logic     It s no use looking for logic in women  R gis  I told you  they re not like men  In fact  I ve come to the conclusion that they re not even the same species as men  Men and women aren t like dog and bitch  they re more like dog and cat  C est bizarre  non  In any case  I do know you can t keep two women on the go without something happening  I don t know what  but something    Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Pr fecture de police  Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings  and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them  They wanted constantly to know more  So of course did Inspector Dutruelle    I assure you  gentlemen   he told a press conference   we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts  We are doing everything possible  You can tell your readers that wherever they are  we ll find them     Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers   asked one of the foreign reporters    So as we know which heads we re looking for   added a journalist from London   It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris  Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated  Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations  Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances  Even the beggars  who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages  had gone  And the few passengers who remained sat more long faced than ever  or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms   Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up  His mind  already excited over Vololona  was now in a turmoil  Vololona had suddenly  and tearfully  announced that she was pregnant  Then  having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy   but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic   she told him one day on the telephone   I thought you were going to ask me to marry you   Inspector Dutruelle was stunned    But you know I m married  ma ch rie   he said    I thought you d leave Agnes   she replied   I wanted to be with you  I wanted to share everything with you       my child       my life       my bed   Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing    But darling  we can still see each other     No  it s too painful  I love you too much    Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all  Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona  he longed to be with her  If only Agnes would leave him  And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already   the dinners  the presents  the apartment  Why did women have to possess you  It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took  until there was nothing left to give but yourself  Perhaps Pierre was right after all  when you thought about it   The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally  Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect  no leads  no motive  His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity   It appears   commented France Soir   that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer   The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector  and they felt leaderless and demoralised  It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact  that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common   their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart  and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them   Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport  and he especially did not like the Metro  It was cramped  smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times  and in the summer it was hot  You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station  It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro    I can t take much more of this  Marc  he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him   it s too hot  We ll get off at the next stop     That s Barbes Rochechouart  sir  We can change there     No  Marc  We can get out there  Someone else can take a sauna  I ve had enough  Anyway  we need to have a look around   Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow  He sounded irritable   God knows what it s like normally   he added   When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart    At least we can get through now   said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator    How d you mean   asked Inspector Dutruelle    Well  normally this station s packed   beggars  passengers  buskers  hawkers  plus all their tables and stalls  It s like a damn great fair and market rolled into one  You can get anything here  from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes   not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin     Oh  yes   said Inspector Dutruelle  vaguely   I remember   He passed a handkerchief across his brow again   At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle s hand  Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight  the Inspector read aloud    Professor Dhiakobli  Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life          He broke off in mid sentence with a snort    What a lot of mumbo jumbo  Headless chickens and voodoo magic     It may be mumbo jumbo to you  sir   said the Detective Constable with a laugh   but round here they take that sort of thing seriously  And not only round here   after all  we use some of these techniques in the police  don t we     Oh really  Such as     Well  graphology for a start   you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone s handwriting scientific  can you sir  Or what about astrology   employing people on the basis of the stars  Or numerology     Yes  Marc   said Inspector Dutruelle  pushing the card into his top pocket   maybe you re right  and maybe when you re older you won t be so sure  Now get on the blower and call the car    The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August  No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro  and the media  bored with the lack of developments  left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity  Paris  deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast  was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro  Then  in September  the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal   But Inspector Dutruelle s passion for Vololona did not cool with the season  Vololona had at last agreed to see him  occasionally  but she always managed  with tears in her eyes  to deflect his more amorous advances  For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment  but he was growing increasingly frustrated  The notion that she had another lover obsessed him  and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin  Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door  as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees  Now  denied the one thing here he wanted  the scene filled him with dismay  Money and music were in the air  Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways  Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini skirts hurried to work  Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon lit video clubs  Somewhere deep below ran the Metro  but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that  His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things  Sometimes he would stay all night  leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night s revelries  Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes  but he never once saw her on the arm of another man  or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor   One night  late in October  he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight  Madame Dutruelle  having been told that her husband was working on a case  and perhaps believing it  was already asleep  Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair  for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes  the sort of man who irons his shoelaces  But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor  Muttering to himself  the Inspector bent and picked it up  and as he did so something fell from the top pocket  He gazed at it blankly for a moment  Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station  a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners  but still legible  He picked it up and slowly started to read   PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life  luck  love  marriage  attraction of clients  examinations  sexual potency  If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another  this is his domain  you will be loved and your partner will return  Prof  Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog  He will create between you a perfect rapport on the basis of love  All problems resolved  even desperate cases  Every day from  am to  pm  Payment after results    b  rue Beldamme        Paris staircase B   th floor  door on left Metro  Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again   All problems resolved        It was preposterous  And yet  it was tempting  What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed  After all  everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it   Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris s eighteenth arrondissement  an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa  It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way  cursing because he had not brought his umbrella  The door to number   b was swinging in the wind  its dark paint peeling badly  He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth floor door on which a brass plaque read   Professor Dhiakobli Sp cialiste des travaux occultes Please ring   He stood there  breathing heavily from the stairs  and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared    Please enter  my dear sir   said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy   I am Dhiakobli  And I have the honour to meet           As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined  Professor Dhiakobli was black  He had a short yet commanding figure  and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit  A large  silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket    For the moment   said Inspector Dutruelle   my name is hardly important  I ve only come in response to your advertisement     Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help  A minor indiscretion  Please be seated  sir  and let us talk about the matter    Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large  well upholstered chair to which he had been directed  Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk  on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging  its wide  moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer    Ah  I see that Zeus approves of you   said the Professor  stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers  his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle   Poor Zeus  mon petit papillon  he is devoted to me  but he must remain here whenever I leave France  And you are fortunate  monsieur  It is only now that I return from C te d Ivoire  It is my country you know  I return there for a few months each summer  Paris in summer is so disagreeable  don t you agree    Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success  The frames of his glasses  the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left  the gem studded rings on his fingers   all were of gold  From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man  Around him the large room was like a shrine  Heavy curtains excluded the daylight  the only illumination was a small brass desklamp  and the dark  red walls were festooned with spears  costumes  photographs and other African memorabilia  There was a sweet smell in the air  and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator  You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris    As I say   began Inspector Dutruelle  ignoring the Professor s question   I saw your card and I wondered just how you work     And may one enquire as to monsieur s little difficulty    Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could    Well     he coughed again    first of all  I wondered what sort of things you can help people with    The Professor s eyebrows rose    Anything   he said slowly  his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin   My dear sir  anything at all     And then  I wondered  how do you operate  That s to say  what exactly do you do       and how do you charge     Ah monsieur  let us not talk of money  First I must learn just how I can help you  And for that a consultation is in order    Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat    And what would a consultation involve  What does it       cost    Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably    Mon cher monsieur  I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money  I too recoil at the mere thought of it  It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune  And if some donate a small token of their gratitude  who am I to refuse their offering  They pay according to their means  to assist those who have little to offer  But for a preliminary consultation  monsieur  a nominal sum  as a mark of good faith  is usually in order  For a gentleman of your obvious standing  a trifle  a mere two hundred francs  And let me assure you  monsieur  of my absolute discretion  Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls   He paused  Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin   They have the sanctity of the confessional     I m glad to hear it   said the Inspector    But monsieur still has the advantage of me        continued Professor Dhiakobli   Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking  He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier  a Parisien wine merchant  and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul  He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients  of their instant and passionate love for one another  of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him  and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave  Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits  end and now even his business was suffering  He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret  The Professor listened intently  asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments  Finally Inspector Dutruelle said   Well  Professor Dhiakobli  I think that s all I can tell you  I don t think I can tell you any more  From what I have told you  do you believe you can help me    For a long time there was silence  The Professor appeared to be in another world  He stared at Inspector Dutruelle  but seemed to be looking through him    My dear Monsieur Mazodier   he said at last  very slowly  almost mechanically   the story you have told me is most poignant  Each of us has a hidden corner in his life  a jardin secret  Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours  Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women  At the mercy of their complex physical structure  is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures  I help them find their lost ones  their partners of many years  to recreate again the rapport of their youth  You will understand that it is not easy  But this is my work  My domain     So you can t help me   said Inspector Dutruelle  adding despondently   Perhaps what I really need is a head shrink    The Professor gave a start  Again  for a long time he did not answer  Then his teeth flashed in the dimness     coutez monsieur  this is my work  my domain   he repeated   Certainly I can help you  But you must understand that it will not be easy  It calls for a special ceremony  In the first place  you are married  and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women  In the second  we are both men of the world  monsieur  and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages  And finally  it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic  You know  the magic of Madagascar is very strong  No  monsieur  it will not be easy  Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone  Sometimes        He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye  his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant   Sometimes   he said   we must make sacrifices     What sort of sacrifices   asked Inspector Dutruelle dully    Oh  my dear sir  you must leave that to me  But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs   His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath   You must not concern yourself with technicalities  monsieur  Your mind must be fixed on the future  on the life you have dreamed of  You must envisage your wife   happy in the arms of another  You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for       secure in your arms       sharing your life       your days       your nights  The perfect solution to all your problems  Is it not worth a considerable sum     It certainly would be worth a lot        Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor s words came to life in his mind    Shall we say thirty thousand francs     I m sorry   muttered the Inspector    Let s say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards   the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken   Do you see  monsieur  how confident I am of success    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was confused  He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt  or to propose quite so generous a token  But it did not seem to matter  After all  what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately  And  in any case  at worst it was only fifteen thousand   The Professor s eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle    Of course  monsieur  I have faith in your gratitude  I know that you will not forget  in your delight  that what I have done  I can undo  And now  monsieur  you must not allow me to detain you further  We have much work to do  In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy  And with some little articles of clothing  something close to their thoughts  say a scarf or a hat  You can arrange this    Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly    Excellent  monsieur  I must know them in every detail   if I am to have a spiritual t te   t te with each of them  So  in fifteen days  you will return for the ceremony  It will take place beyond those curtains  in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits  Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there  but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day  It must be at dawn  and you must come without fail   the ceremony cannot be deferred  Can you manage six in the morning  shall we say Monday the sixteenth    Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December  At four o clock in the morning he got out of bed  Though his wife stirred she did not wake  He showered and dressed  His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen  boiling water for his coffee  He drank two cups  strong and black  but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam  He lit a Gauloise and paced the room  Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing  finishing his cigarette  Below him the courtyard was dark and silent  and above him the sky was black  But away in the east  through the open end of the court  a violet hue was creeping over Paris  He glanced at his watch  It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car  It would seem strange  leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver  He wondered what the concierge would make of it all   she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor  He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut   Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything  He looked into the bedroom  Gently  he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept  her arms clasped about her knees  He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek  Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him  switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen  and opened the front door  As he did so the telephone rang  It startled him and he cursed aloud  He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake    Inspector Dutruelle   said the voice at the other end    Yes  what is it     Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning  Monsieur l Inspecteur  It s the Pr fecture     Never mind the time   said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey   I m off duty today     Well  that s the point  Inspector  The Pr fet s ordered us to call you specially  He appreciates you re not on duty  but he wants you anyway     It s quite impossible     I m afraid he insists  sir     Why     He insists you come on duty immediately  sir  We re sending a car round for you     Yes  yes  I understand  but why     It s the Metro again  sir     The Metro     Yes  sir  They ve found another corpse on the line  decapitated again    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was cursing to himself  He was cursing the Pr fet  the police  this homicidal maniac  his wife  Why today  Why ever today    Sir  Hello sir  The car ll be with you in five minutes     Yes  all right  I ll be ready in five minutes    The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf  Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine  His dreams  it seemed  were evaporating just as surely    You d better brief me on this as quick as you can   he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car   Where was the body found     Barbes Rochechouart  sir    A cold shiver passed through the Inspector    I presume it s the same as the others   he asked    Well  in as much as there s nothing to go on  it s the same  sir  Otherwise it couldn t be more different  For a start  we ve just heard they ve found two of them now  And this time they re women  One white  in her forties  and one black  A young black girl   still in her teens  by the look of things    But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening  He was staring blankly through the glass to his right  and as they turned at Place du Ch telet the empty streets were no more than a cold  grey blur to him  The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de S bastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart  It was the route he should have been taking in his own car   Outside the station  now closed to passengers  people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up  Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car  He hesitated  He glanced towards Rue Beldamme  just a stone s throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart  where the Professor would be waiting for him  He shrugged and went down the station steps   Underground  on the number four line  there was an air of gloom  Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train drivers through that morning  Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one  It was the body of a middle aged woman  quite unexceptional  coarse and wiry  like his wife    She s forty seven  Monsieur l Inspecteur   said somebody beside him   French  Name of Madame Catherine Dubur  Not like the other one     The other one   said the Inspector blankly    I told you in the car  sir   said the Detective Sergeant at his ear   there s two of them     You d better show me    They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track  A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body  which lay on its back  Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff  black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines  Suddenly he shuddered in alarm  Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona    Identity   he asked  He tried to control his voice    We don t know  sir   this is all we found   said a policeman  handing him a tattered greetings card  Inside  in large  green handwriting  were the words   Happy Nineteenth Birthday  from Everyone in Antananarivo     D you think she s Malagasy  sir   asked the policeman  The Inspector shrugged his shoulders  then held out an open hand    Your torch  please   he said   He played its beam over the body  up and down the long  slender legs  across the clothes  At least he did not recognise the clothes  Yet the body s size  its build  its colour  everything pointed to Vololona  He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him  He stood up in relief  That was certainly not Vololona  Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her   and the other of Agnes  for that matter  Even the ages were the same   He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse  He could not understand  Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere  And what of Agnes  How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that  How could he explain it  when you came to think of it  When you came to think of it  he had explained very little  He had been happy enough to take the money  and free enough with his words   all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual t te   t tes        Inspector Dutruelle gasped    The devil   he muttered to himself  Suddenly he understood everything    The what  sir   said somebody beside him    Never mind   he answered quietly  putting his hand to his breast pocket  His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions  He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise  Through its curling blue smoke  back lit by the lights of the train  the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance  while beside him men s voices were thrumming in his ear  Why was there no time to think  to extricate himself from this nightmare  He cursed himself  How could he have been so stupid  He cursed his wife and Vololona  And Professor Dhiakobli  What madness had driven him to this  Then he cursed himself again  and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side    What time is it     Six fifteen  sir    For a moment  he hesitated  Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body     coute Guy  when he s got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up   he said   Now get me the Pr fet    The Pr fet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep  and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation    Are you insane  man  You re in the middle of an investigation     The investigation is over  Monsieur le Pr fet     So  you have the killer at last     In fifteen minutes  monsieur  in fifteen minutes     Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty

his first pieces theMaple Leaf Rag  became ragtime s first and most influential hit and has been recognized as the archetypal rag[] Joplin was born into a musical family of laborers in Northeast Texas  and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers most notablyJulius Weiss  Joplin grew up in Texarkana  where he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar During the late s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad and travelled around theAmerican South  as an itinerant musician He went to Chicago for theWorld s Fair  of  which played a major part in making

also brought the composer a steady income for life though Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problemsJoplin moved to St Louis  in  where he continued to compose and publish music and regularly performed in the St Louis community By the time he had moved to St Louis he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearly as a result of having contractedsyphilis  The score to his first opera A Guest of Honor  was confiscated in  with his belongings owing to his nonpayment of bills and is considered

in late  or early  Although for many years his birth date was accepted as November   research has revealed that this is almost certainly inaccurate the most likely approximate date being the second half of []  He was the second of six children the others being Monroe Robert William Myrtle and Ossie[]  born to Giles Joplin an exslave from North Carolina  and Florence Givens a freeborn AfricanAmerican woman fromKentucky [] [] []  The Joplins subsequently moved to Texarkana where Giles worked as a laborer for the railroad while Florence was a cleaner Joplin s father had played theviolin  for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo []  Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned[] At some point in the early s Giles Joplin left the family for another woman leaving Florence to provide for her children through domestic work Biographer Susan Curtis speculated that his mother s support of Joplin s musical education was an important causal factor in this separation His father argued that it took the boy away from practical employment that would supplement the family income[] According to a family friend the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing the piano after school While a few local teachers aided him he received most of his music education fromJulius Weiss  a GermanJewish  music professor who had immigrated to the United States from Germany[]  Weiss had studied music at university in Germany and was listed in town records as aProfessor of music Impressed by Joplin s talent and realizing his family s dire straits Weiss taught him free of charge He tutored the yearold Joplin until he was  during which time Weiss introduced him tofolk  and classical music including opera Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an art as well as an entertainment[]  and helped his mother acquire a used piano According to his wife Lottie Joplin never forgot Weiss and in his later years when he achieved fame as a composer sent his former teacher gifts of money when he was old and ill until Weiss died[]  At the age of  Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana playing piano In addition he taught guitar and mandolin[] Life in the Southern states and Chicago[edit ]In the late s having performed at various local events as a teenager Joplin chose to give up work as a laborer with the railroad and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician[]  Little is known about his movements at this time although he is recorded in Texarkana in July  as a member of theTexarkana Minstrels in a performance that happened to be raising money for a monument toJefferson Davis  President of the Southern Confederacy[]  He soon discovered however that there were few opportunities for black pianists Churches andbrothels  were among the few options for steady work Joplin played preragtime  jigpiano  in variousredlight districts  throughout the midSouth and some claim he was in Sedalia and St Louis during this time[] [] In  Joplin was in Chicago for the World s Fair  While in Chicago he formed his first band playingcornet  and began arranging music for the group to perform Although the World s Fair minimized the involvement of AfricanAmericans black performers still came to the saloons cafs and brothels that lined the fair The exposition was attended by  million Americans and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life including ragtime Although specific information is sparse numerous sources have credited the Chicago World Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime[]  Joplin found that his music as well as that of other black performers was popular with visitors[]  By  ragtime had become a national craze in American cities and was described by theSt Louis Dispatch as a veritable call of the wild which mightily stirred the pulses of city bred people[] Life in Missouri[edit ]A  recording of the Maple Leaf Rag by the United States Marine Band This is the first surviving recording of theMaple Leaf Rag  []  []

At first Joplin stayed with the family ofArthur Marshall  at the time a year old boy but later one of Joplin s students and a ragtime composer in his own right[]  There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until  as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician     Front cover of the third edition of the Maple Leaf Rag sheet music There is little precise evidence known about Joplin s activities at this time although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia theBlack  club and the Maple Leaf Club He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own sixpiece dance orchestra A tour with his own singing group the Texas Medley Quartet gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions and it is known that he went toSyracuse New York  and Texas Two businessmen from New York published Joplin s first two works the songsPlease Say You Will and A Picture of her Face in []  Joplin s visit toTemple Texas  enabled him to have three pieces published there in  including theGreat Crush Collision March  which commemorated aplanned train crash  on the MissouriKansasTexas Railroad  on September  that he may have witnessed The March was described by one of Joplin s biographers as a special early essay in ragtime[]  While in Sedalia he was teaching piano to students who included future ragtime composersArthur Marshall  Brun Campbell  and Scott Hayden []  In turn Joplin enrolled at theGeorge R Smith College  where he apparently studied advanced harmony and composition The College records were destroyed in a fire in []  and biographer Edward A Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for AfricanAmericans would be able to provide such a course[] [] [] In  Joplin married Belle the sisterinlaw of collaborator Scott Hayden  Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the Maple Leaf Rag was published Joplin was not far behind His first published ragOriginal Rags  had been completed in  the same year as the first ragtime work in print theMississippi Rag by William Krell  The Maple Leaf Rag was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in  Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around []  The exact circumstances that led to the Maple Leaf Rag s publication are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers Joplin signed a contract on August   withJohn Stillwell Stark  a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a  royalty on all sales of the rag with a minimum sales price of  cents[]  With the inscription To the Maple Leaf Club prominently visible along the top of at least some editions it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club although there is no direct evidence to prove the link and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time[]     Scott Joplin House  in St Louis Missouri  There have been many claims about the sales of theMaple Leaf Rag for example that Joplin was the first musician to sell  million copies of a piece of instrumental music[]  Joplin s first biographerRudi Blesh  wrote that during its first six months the piece sold  copies and became the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America[]  However research by Joplin s later biographer Edward A Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case the initial printrun of  took one year to sell and under the terms of Joplin s contract with a  royalty would have given Joplin an income of  or approximately at current prices Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses In  estimated sales would have given him an income of  annually approximately in current prices[] The Maple Leaf Rag did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers especially in the development of classic ragtime[]  After the publication of theMaple Leaf Rag Joplin was soon being described as King of rag time writers not least by himself[]  on the covers of his own work such asThe Easy Winners  and Elite Syncopations After the Joplins moved to St Louis  in early  they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth Joplin s relationship with his wife was difficult as she had no interest in music They eventually separated and then divorced[]  About this time Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags[]  It was in St Louis that Joplin produced some of his bestknown works includingThe Entertainer  March Majestic and the short theatrical work The Ragtime Dance In June  Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock Arkansas  the young woman to whom he had dedicatedThe Chrysanthemum She died on September   of complications resulting from a cold ten weeks after their wedding[]  Joplin s first work copyrighted after Freddie s death Bethena  was described by one biographer as an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtimewaltzes [] During this time Joplin created an opera company of  people and produced his first operaA Guest of Honor  for a national tour It is not certain how many productions were staged or even if this was an allblack show or a racially mixed production During the tour either inSpringfield Illinois  orPittsburg Kansas  someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts Joplin could not meet the company s payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house It is believed that the score forA Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of nonpayment of the company s boarding house bill[] Later years[edit ]     Front cover of the Wall Street Rag  sheet music In  Joplin moved to New York City which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera After his move to New York Joplin met Lottie Stokes whom he married in []  In  unable to find a publisher Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishingTreemonisha  himself in pianovocal format In  as a lastditch effort to see it performed he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall inHarlem  Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment it was a miserable failure to a public not ready for crude black musical formsso different from the European grand opera of that time[]  The audience including potential backers was indifferent and walked out[]  Scott writes that after a disastrous single performance  Joplin suffered a breakdown He was bankrupt discouraged and worn out He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles Treemonisha went unnoticed and unreviewed largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music a field closed to African Americans[]  In fact it was not until the s that the opera received a full theatrical stagingIn  Joplin and Lottie selfpublished his Magnetic Rag  as the Scott Joplin Music Company which he had formed the previous December[]  Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due tosyphilis  and was consciously racing against time In her sleeve notes on the Deutsche Grammophon  release of Treemonisha  she notes that he plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera day and night with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts page by page as each page of the full score was completed[] Death[edit ]By  Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilis  and a resulting descent into insanity[] []  In January  he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital  a mental institution[]  He died there on April  of syphilitic dementia at the age of [] []  and was buried in a pauper s grave that remained unmarked for  years His grave at Saint Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in []

music and Joplin s natural ability has been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended AfricanAmerican musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the sragtime [] When Joplin was learning the piano serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs cranked out by the tunesmiths ofTin Pan Alley []  As a composer Joplin refined ragtime elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the wandering honkytonk pianists playing mere dance music of popular imagination[]  This new art form the classic rag  combined AfroAmerican folk music ssyncopation  and thcentury European romanticism  with its harmonic schemes and its marchlike tempos[] []  In the words of one critic Ragtime was basically an AfroAmerican version of the polka or its analog theSousa style march[]  With this as a foundation Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them without improvisation[]  Joplin wrote his rags as classical music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its cheap bordello origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as  more tuneful contrapuntal infectious and harmonically colorful than any others of his era[] Some speculate that Joplin s achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacherJulius Weiss  who may have brought a polka  rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the year old Joplin[]  As Curtis put it The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware[] Joplin s first and most significant hit the Maple Leaf Rag was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least  years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns melody lines and harmony[]  though with the exception of Joseph Lamb  they generally failed to enlarge upon it[] Treemonisha[edit ]    Treemonisha    Main article Treemonisha  The opera s setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin s childhood town Texarkana in September  The plot centers on an year old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps  nest when her friend Remus rescues her The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader[] [] [] Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias ensembles and choruses In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident inTreemonisha are common in the operatic tradition and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composerRichard Wagner  of which Joplin was aware A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from inDie Walkre  and the retelling of the heroine s origins echos aspects of the operaSiegfried  In addition AfricanAmerican folk tales also influence the storythe wasp nest incident is similar to the story ofBr er Rabbit  and the briar patch[] Treemonisha is not a ragtime operabecause Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly using them to convey racial character and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the th century The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late th century recreated by a skilled and sensitive participant[] Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin s own life He notes that Lottie Joplin the composer s third wife saw a connection between the character Treemonisha s wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer In addition it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie Joplin s second wife because the date of the opera s setting was likely to have been the month of her birth[] At the time of the opera s publication in  the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as an entirely new form of operatic art[]  Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history with its heroine a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement[]  Curtis s conclusion is similar In the end Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy learning hard work and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race[]  Berlin describes it as a fine opera certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States but later states that Joplin s own libretto showed the composer was not a competent dramatist with the book not up to the quality of the music[] Performance skills[edit ]Pleasant Moments Ragtime Waltz played by Scott Joplin April   Sorry your browser either has JavaScript disabled or

Sedalia  newspaper in  and fellow ragtime composersArthur Marshall  and Joe Jordan  both said that he played the instrument well[]  However the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper rather than at the pianoArtie Matthews  recalled the delight the St Louis players took in outplaying Joplin[] While Joplin never made an audio recording his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls  for use in mechanical player pianos  All seven were made in  Of these the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing[]  probably by William Axtmann the staff arranger at Connorized[]  Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St Louis he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearlyall symptoms of thesyphilis  that took his life in []  Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of Maple Leaf Rag on the UniRecord label from June  as shocking disorganized and completely distressing to hear[]  While there is disagreement among pianoroll experts about the accuracy of the reproduction of a player s performance[] [] [] []  Berlin notes that the Maple Leaf Rag roll was painfully bad and likely to be the truest record of Joplin s playing at the time The roll however does not reflect his abilities earlier in life[] Legacy[edit ]     Nonpareil  Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes changing American musical taste Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties  Joplin s ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America[] Joshua Rifkin  a leading Joplin recording artist wrote A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work and even at his most highspirited he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity  He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him[]  Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety  Joplin did for the rag whatChopin  did for themazurka  His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated thebolero  and the tango []  Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin s music had helped to revolutionise American music and culture by removing Victorian restraint[] Composer and actor Max Morath  found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin s work did not enjoy the popularity of theMaple Leaf Rag because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his lifetime[]  Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin opined thatMaple Leaf Rag would make him  King of Ragtime Composers  but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime  When I m dead twentyfive years people are going to recognize me  he told a friend Just over thirty years later he was recognized and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin[] Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music And as a pioneer composer and performer he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of both races After his death jazz historian Floyd Levin noted Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers the man who gave America a genuine native music[] Revival[edit ]After his death in  Joplin s music and ragtime in general waned in popularity as new forms of musical styles such asjazz  and novelty piano  emerged Even so jazz bands and recording artists such asTommy Dorsey  in Jelly Roll Morton  in  and J Russell Robinson  in  released recordings of Joplin compositionsMaple Leaf Rag was the Joplin piece found most often on rpm  records[] In the s a smallscale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars such as Trebor TichenorWilliam Bolcom  William Albright  and Rudi Blesh  Audiophile Records  released a two record setThe Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin The Greatest of Ragtime Composers performed by Knocky Parker  in [] In  Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin  a young musicologist in the body of Joplin s work Together they hosted an occasional ragtimeandearlyjazz evening onWBAI  radio[]  In November  Rifkin released a recording calledScott Joplin Piano Rags []  on the classical  label Nonesuch  It sold  copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch s first millionselling record[]  The Billboard BestSelling Classical LPs chart for September   has the record at number  with the followup Volume  at number  and a combined set of both volumes at number  Separately both volumes had been on the chart for  weeks In the top  spots on that chart  of the entries were recordings of Joplin s work three of which were Rifkin s[]  Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section The album was nominated in  for twoGrammy Award  categories Best Album Notes  and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance without orchestra  Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin but at the ceremony on March   Rifkin did not win in any category[]  He did a tour in  which included appearances on BBC  Television and a sellout concert at London sRoyal Festival Hall []  In Alan Rich  in the New York Magazine  wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin s music on diskNonesuch Records  created almost alone the Scott Joplin revival[] In January  Harold C Schonberg  music critic at the New York Times  having just heard the Rifkin album wrote a featured Sunday edition article entitled Scholars Get Busy on Scott Joplin[]  Schonberg s call to action has been described as the catalyst for classical music scholars the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life to conclude that Joplin was a genius[]  Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library  published a

RecordsMore Scott Joplin Rags in  and The Road From Rags To Jazz in In  film producer George Roy Hill  contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately asking each man to write the score for a film project he was working onThe Sting  Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments Instead Hill foundMarvin Hamlisch  available and brought him into the project as composer[]  Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin s music for theThe Sting for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation  on April  []  His version of The Entertainer reached number  on theBillboard Hot   and the American Top   music chart on May  [] []  prompting The New York Times  to write The whole nation has begun to take notice[]  Thanks to the film and its score Joplin s work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world becoming in the words of music magazineRecord World  the classical phenomenon of the decade[]  Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin s style and his band adaptations from Schuller s style[]  Schuller said Hamlisch got the Oscar for music he didn t write since it is by Joplin and arrangements he didn t write and  editions  he didn t make A lot of people were upset by that but that s show biz[] On October   excerpts from Treemonisha were presented in concert form atLincoln Center  with musical performances by Bolcom Rifkin and Mary Lou Williams  supporting a group of singers[]  Finally on January   TJ Anderson s orchestration ofTreemonisha was staged for two consecutive

2014-07-05 17:32:24 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex   How to Avoid Burnout Are You Falling for This Myth   You want to earn a spot in your niche with your incredible range of insights and experience  So you work diligently by squeezing content creation in between meetings  calls  emails  professional projects  home projects  family time  and much more   You think you’re on a great track and you’ll never burn out as long as you keep up your momentum   Eventually  you start to stay a little later working on projects and even work on weekends  You begin worrying about whether it’s working or if you should hedge your bets with this whole writing thing    Never mind   you say  You still hold on to the idea that you will never burn out   giving up and in to burnout is for idle  non dedicated people who don’t share your vision or passion  Short of an uncontrollable disaster  all you have to do is keep up this momentum and your hard work will pay off in the end   right  Wrong   A Seemingly Never Ending Balancing Act  That phrase you keep repeating   I’ll never burn out   is a myth  This busywork that’s masquerading as  dedication  is the road to burnout  How do you know   Do any of the following statements apply to you        Bad  days are more frequent than good      Most of your time is spent on tasks that seem impossible or are monotonous      You’re exhausted   if not all of the time  most of the time      You don’t feel appreciated or what you do makes a difference      You feel unmotivated   you can’t see value in caring about your work or even home life      You’re overwhelmed by venturing into a new territory      You feel like you’re going nowhere   If none of these apply to you  feel free to skip to the end and share your secrets to burnout prevention  If any of these apply to you  even in the slightest increment  then you’re showing signs of burnout  In turn  this could be negatively affecting your ability to accomplish your goals and have serious physical repercussions  The time is now to deal with it because you have a lot to lose if burnout gets the best of you   It’s Time for a Time Out  To address and prevent burnout  you need to stop and take a step back  Consider not only how you got there  but how you will bail yourself out to replenish your energy to accomplish your greater goals  Use these tips       Take a break        I can’t slow down   I have all of these things to do   Once you’ve reached burnout status  it’s hard to break habits that either serve little value or perpetuate the burnout balancing act  Slow down  This isn’t a request  Do it  Where you can  cut back on commitments that show little value and ask for help or delegate tasks  such as asking someone to proofread your content for you or even consider hiring a ghostwriter or transcriber  You cannot accomplish everything at once and deliver quality  Give yourself some time to recharge both your mind and body       Reevaluate your goals and priorities        I don’t even know where to begin    Here’s an exercise to get you started       Break down your obligations  duties  and tasks into two columns  In the first column  write all of those things people are depending on you to accomplish or what can only be done by you  In the second column  write down those things you do that could be done by someone else or reasonably eliminated altogether       Think of each item in your second column to be your  burnout relief  to do list by delegating these tasks or jettisoning them from your routine if they lack value       Next  write down your goals   personal  home  writing  and work goals that will create value in your life and work  Compare your goals to your first column  Is there anything that you can move over to the second column  Allow your goals to be the ruler that helps you measure your tasks and commitments   if it doesn’t measure up  delegate or eliminate it       For all commitments and tasks that remain in the first column  create a plan       Have a plan and rekindle your motivation        A goal is just a wish without a plan   Whatever type of plan you choose to implement   whether it targets your personal  professional  or writing goals   make sure it contains at least these three elements          It targets a specific goal          It’s broken into actionable steps          It’s rewarding   What I Do to Prevent Burnout  I’m S M A R T    that is  I plan S M A R T  goals by asking myself the following questions       Specific  What do I want to accomplish and what are its requirements or constraints      Measurable  What are the indicators I use to measure its success or achievement      Achievable  What are the steps I will take to accomplish this goal      Relevant  Is it worthwhile      Timely  What milestones should I meet or when will it be finally accomplished   Another strategy I’m a huge fan of is the to do list   daily lists  project lists  writing lists  shopping lists  activity lists  and honey do lists  a list for my husband      anything can chunked into a list  Call me peculiar  but I find an indescribable satisfaction in checking off each item as I finish it  which creates a powerful momentum that propels me through each task  For tasks I didn’t plan for and do  I’ll add it to my list  after the fact  to cross it off   Don’t wait  When you’re burned out  anything and everything can be a bear to handle  Change your course  Own your plan  Wear it out like a pair of running shoes until you can see through the soles because of all of the mileage you got out of it  Use these tips to alleviate stress  prevent burnout  and add more valuable contributions to your family  your niche  and your own peace of mind   What do you do to avoid burnout  Let us know   we’d love to hear from you

author Alison K Klika ms Cleveland Clinic  Euclid Ave A Cleveland OH  emailklikaaatccforg   Next Section  AbstractBackground Longterm acute care hospitals are an option for patients in intensive care units who require prolonged care after an acute illness Predicting use of these facilities may help hospitals improve resource management expenditures and quality of care delivered in intensive careObjective To develop a predictive tool for early identification of intensive care patients with increased probability of transfer to such a hospitalMethods Data on  adults admitted to intensive care at a tertiary care hospital between January  and June  were retrospectively reviewed The prediction model was developed by using multiple ordinal logistic regression The model was internally validated via the bootstrapping technique and externally validated with a control cohort of  intensive care patientsResults Among the study group  patients  were discharged to longterm acute care hospitals and   to home or other care facilities   died in the intensive care unit The final prediction algorithm showed good accuracy biascorrected concordance index   CI  excellent calibration and external validation concordance index   CI  Hypoalbuminemia was the greatest potential driver of increased likelihood of discharge to a longterm acute care hospital Other important predictors were intensive care unit category older age extended hospital stay before admission to intensive care severe pressure ulcers admission source and dependency on mechanical ventilationConclusions This new predictive tool can help estimate on the first day of admission to intensive care the likelihood of a patients discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalThe economic impact of and demand for critical care services in the United States are intensifying From  to  annual critical care expenditures increased from  billion to  billion  In  critical care services accounted for approximately  of national health care expenditures and  of the US gross domestic product  Part of the increased costs and demand for intensive care unit ICU services are due to a subgroup of critically ill patients who survive acute illness and require prolonged lifesupport care   These patients also termed chronically critically ill represent a problem of growing importance Chronically critically ill patients account for only  to  of all ICU admissions but for approximately  of total ICU expenditures   The increasing costs and demand for critical care services in the United States have resulted in greater emphasis on efficient ICU resource management and improvement in quality of care    Development of care practices for chronically critically ill patients is a considerable challenge not only for ICU clinicians but also for the health system as a whole  Changes in reimbursement and the continued increase in the number of chronically critically ill patients have increased pressures on acute care hospitals to reduce the length of stay and cost of care  Longterm acute care hospitals LTACHs are facilities that have recently emerged in response to the demand for prolonged care after an acute illness  These facilities offer multiple benefits to patients and acute care hospitals including reduction of underreimbursed costs more efficient ICU bed procurement and improvement of benchmarking measurements     As a result the utilization and number of LTACHs have been increasing at a high rate Our primary objective in this study was to develop a predictive algorithm for early identification of ICU patients with a high probability of discharge to an LTACH We hypothesized that sufficient accuracy could be achieved by using predictor variables that were available within the first  hours of ICU admission Formerly no such predictive instrument has existed Although experienced ICU clinicians may use various clinical characteristics and laboratory results to estimate the future need for LTACH transfer this clinical assessment can be influenced by multiple biases  A predictive tool permits the clinical care team to make decisions based on and supported by objective data rather than subjective intuition Individualized prediction of discharge to an LTACH may allow for strategic planning to improve ICU resource management and quality of care In addition early and objective identification of ICU patients with the greatest likelihood of LTACH transfer could facilitate LTACH referrals encourage preparation of patients and their families and decrease financial issues for the patients and the hospitalsIncreased costs for ICU services come in part from the chronically critically illPrevious Section  Next Section  MethodsSample SelectionThis retrospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center with  adult ICU beds Approval was granted by the appropriate institutional review board informed consent was not required Data for development of the model were obtained from the medical records of  patients  years or older who had been admitted to an ICU between January  and June VariablesA team of clinicians and research staff developed a list of  demographic ICU admission and medical variables that they thought had empirical or theoretical relevance to discharge to an LTACH seeTable  Demographic variables included age sex and body mass index ICU admission was summarized by  variables length of stay before ICU admission source of admission ICU category and type of ICU admission Length of stay before ICU admission was defined as the number of days the patient stayed in the hospital directly before being admitted to the ICU Source of admission was the site from which the patient was transferred to the ICU  the emergency department  the hospital unit or operating room or  a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or an other hospital ICU category was defined as the admitting ICU cardiovascular coronary heart failure medical neurosurgical surgical Type of ICU admission indicated whether or not the admission was planned or anticipated by the care team ie discussed in notes before the admission or treatment intervention The remaining  physiological and laboratory variables were measures of medical status during the first  hours of ICU admission The response variable discharge disposition was collapsed into  categories LTACH home or other care facilities ie nonLTACH and death in the ICU Other care facilities encompassed skilled nursing facilities as well as acute and chronic rehabilitation facilitiesView this table   In this window    In a new window  Table Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis of model development cohortStatistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version  SAS Institute Inc and R statistical software version  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Univariate analyses to compare the LTACH group with the nonLTACH and ICUdeath groups were performed by using the MannWhitney test Pearson  test or Fisher exact test as appropriate Differences were considered significant atP   With all  established variables see Table  a multiple ordinal logistic regression model was developed to predict the outcome of LTACH discharge A simultaneous approach ie all variables entered at a single step was implemented rather than a stepwise procedure for analysis as recommended by Harrell et al  Missing data in the development cohort were estimated by using themice multivariate imputation by chained equations function in R statistical software generating several imputations by using Gibbs sampling  The coefficients from the resulting multiple logistic regression model were used to construct a paperbased graphic calculation tool called a nomogram by using the design library of R statistical software Points for each predictor were determined by rescaling the regression coefficients to adapt to a userfriendly point scale Variable importance in the final model was ascertained from the relative potential contribution of points as deduced from the nomogram and the length of the axis Variables with longer axes have greater potential predictive effect in the modelInternal validation of the model with the original development data was determined by using the bootstrapping technique to correct for overfitting bias  During this process a random bootstrap sample of the original data was generated from the cohort and the model was applied to this sample to yield predicted results  This technique was repeated  times to obtain a biascorrected estimate of the models predictive accuracy Discrimination of the model was quantified by using the concordance index ie the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve The concordance index ranges from  random discrimination to  perfect discrimination and represents the ability of the model to accurately assign a higher probability to the patient discharged to LTACH for a randomly selected pair of patients with one discharged to LTACH and the other not Typically predictive tests are considered of clinical value when the concordance index is greater than    Calibration an additional measure of model performance illustrates how well the models predictions agree with the observed outcomes Calibration was assessed graphically by plotting predicted vs actual probabilities for discharge to LTACH A model with perfect predictions generates a calibration curve that lies on the  lineTwentyone variables that had empirical or theoretical relevance to longterm acute care were usedThe predictive tool was externally validated with an independent cohort of  ICU patients at the same institution admitted between January  and March  The sample size of the validation cohort was estimated to provide greater than  statistical power to conclude a concordance index of the validation data set assumed to be approximately  on the basis of the data for the development cohort is significantly greater than  Discrimination of the model on the external validation sample was quantified with the concordance index and calibration was assessed graphicallyUsing the nomogram Figure   to calculate the predicted probability of LTACH discharge requires the following steps  locate the patients category or value on the axis corresponding to the respective predictor variable  draw a vertical line upward to the points axis to determine how many points are assigned for that characteristic in the model  repeat this process for the remaining predictor variable axes determining the points for each predictor independently  sum the points achieved for all predictors  locate this summed point value on the total points axis and draw a vertical line down to the probability axis to calculate the

hypoalbuminemia ie serum level of albumin  gdL is potentially the most influential predictor of increased likelihood of discharge to an LTACH ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU particularly neurosurgical ICU older age ie  years extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission ie  days presence of stage  or higher pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early dependency on mechanical ventilation also contribute substantial points  points or higher to the model increasing the predicted probability of LTACH discharge Only extreme values of PaO serum levels of creatinine or total bilirubin or platelet count contribute any meaningful amounts to the predicted risk Sex and requirements for dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine during the first  hours of ICU admission have minor impacts on the prediction of discharge to an LTACH ie contributed a relatively small number of points to the nomogram total score

validation data setPrevious Section  Next Section  DiscussionWe used demographic ICU admission and ICU clinical data measured during the first  hours of ICU admission to construct and validate a predictive model for estimating future use of an LTACH The models discrimination and calibration in the development and validation cohorts indicate it makes it possible to accurately predict the likelihood of LTACH use among ICU patients The most potentially influential determinants of this outcome included hypoalbuminemia ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU older age extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission presence of severe pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early requirement for mechanical ventilation These findings confirm and extend those of previous investigations   which have shown that in addition to dependency on mechanical ventilation older age and greater severity of illness other considerations are important for assessing disposition of discharge from an ICUThe model shows a strong direct association between hypoalbuminemia and the likelihood of discharge to an LTACH This finding may be explained by the underlying nutritional status hepatic failure cirrhosis andor acute response to stress or sepsis among critically ill patients   Several studies   have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased mortality morbidity ICU length of stay and resource utilization in critically ill patients Scheinhorn et al  found that hypoalbuminemia was common among patients admitted to an LTACH and previous investigators   emphasized its importance in predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation and chronic critical illness ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU contribute substantial points to the models predicted risk for discharge to an LTACH This result most likely occurs because these noncardiovascular ICUs typically receive more unplanned critically ill ICU patients than does a cardiovascular ICU A majority of cardiovascular ICU admissions  in a cardiovascular ICU vs  in all other ICUs are planned temporary eg  hours ICU transfers immediately after surgery as a monitoring precaution before the patient is moved to a stepdown unit Finally the predictive value of deepwound pressure ulceration within the LTACH discharge model is supported by the results of other investigations    The frequency of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients is a result of multiple comorbid conditions inability to move impaired angiogenesis response and dependency on mechanical ventilation  Our results suggest that stage  or higher pressure ulcers early in the ICU admission are associated with a higher likelihood of discharge to an LTACHOur findings are especially relevant because of the current initiatives to improve care practices for patients who are chronically critically ill      Early identification of LTACH use may allow clinical care teams to make appropriate arrangements for patients care after discharge from the ICU improve the transition of care ensure bed availability and avoid potential delays in patients discharge As emphasized by Zimmerman et al  discharge planning started shortly after ICU admission allows for more efficient use of ICU resources Enhanced ICU bed utilization has a variety of clinical implications including potentially better outcomes and farreaching financial value Older age presence of severe pressure ulcers early mechanical ventilation are also predictors of discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalLTACHs may improve outcomes for chronically critically ill patients through specialized care These hospitals often embrace a multidisciplinary and rehabilitationbased approach to treatment providing a setting with experienced health professionals and ample clinical resources for the care of patients who are chronically critically ill     Votto et al  reported that the clinical outcomes including inhospital mortality and discharges to home were significantly better for patients transferred to an LTACH than for similar patients who remained in acute care hospitals Furthermore patients treated at an LTACH are less likely to be readmitted to an acute care hospital than are those treated in alternative care settings after discharge from an ICU In addition to potential clinical benefits financial advantages may exist that support the use of LTACHs for chronically critically ill patients Cost reduction by LTACHs has been achieved by focusing on efficient staff operation and incorporation of care protocols as well as service and resource standardization  Votto et al  compared costs between LTACHeligible patients transferred and not transferred to an LTACH and concluded that the mean total cost per patient at an LTACH   was less than that at an acute care hospital  In a study  of critically ill patients with tracheostomies total Medicare expenses related to the admission ie acute and postacute care were less for patients in an LTACH than for patients in other settings Conversely results of a study  examining Medicare claims for a variety of patient types indicated that although patients transferred to an LTACH had decreased costs in the acute setting their total cost of care was higher than that of patients discharged to other postacute care facilities eg skilled nursing facility rehabilitation facility Although evidence     indicates that LTACH utilization results in considerable cost savings for acute care hospitals the economic impact of LTACH facilities on US health care expenditures is still undeterminedUnfortunately evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of LTACH utilization to treat patients with longterm illnesses The current interpretation is primarily based on retrospective studies which may introduce multiple biases The economic impact of LTACH utilization and whether these facilities actually help improve the longterm outcomes of chronically critically ill patients must be properly evaluated If compelling evidence supports therapeutic benefits of LTACH usage implementation of interventions designed to discharge chronically critically ill patients to an LTACH would be a safe approach to providing critical care services in a costeffective wayOur study has some notable limitations Our development and validation cohorts were patients admitted to a single tertiary care institution a situation that may limit the applicability of the results In addition the retrospective design may have introduced ascertainment bias The study design also restricted our analysis to data contained within the electronic health records preventing us from including other factors known to influence LTACH utilization such as payer source patient and clinician preference LTACH discharge criteria bed availability and geographic limitations  Previous Section  Next Section  ConclusionsThis study was our first effort at developing a clinical instrument to predict early in a patients ICU admission the probability of that patients discharge to an LTACH We think that this predictive tool offers a valuable perspective for patients patients family members clinicians and hospitals When complemented by the clinicians judgment as well as feedback from patients and their family members this risk calculator has the potential to improve the quality of care delivered to chronically critically ill patients while enhancing ICU resource managementPrevious Section  Next

his first pieces theMaple Leaf Rag  became ragtime s first and most influential hit and has been recognized as the archetypal rag[] Joplin was born into a musical family of laborers in Northeast Texas  and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers most notablyJulius Weiss  Joplin grew up in Texarkana  where he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar During the late s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad and travelled around theAmerican South  as an itinerant musician He went to Chicago for theWorld s Fair  of  which played a major part in making

in late  or early  Although for many years his birth date was accepted as November   research has revealed that this is almost certainly inaccurate the most likely approximate date being the second half of []  He was the second of six children the others being Monroe Robert William Myrtle and Ossie[]  born to Giles Joplin an exslave from North Carolina  and Florence Givens a freeborn AfricanAmerican woman fromKentucky [] [] []  The Joplins subsequently moved to Texarkana where Giles worked as a laborer for the railroad while Florence was a cleaner Joplin s father had played theviolin  for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo []  Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned[] At some point in the early s Giles Joplin left the family for another woman leaving Florence to provide for her children through domestic work Biographer Susan Curtis speculated that his mother s support of Joplin s musical education was an important causal factor in this separation His father argued that it took the boy away from practical employment that would supplement the family income[] According to a family friend the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing the piano after school While a few local teachers aided him he received most of his music education fromJulius Weiss  a GermanJewish  music professor who had immigrated to the United States from Germany[]  Weiss had studied music at university in Germany and was listed in town records as aProfessor of music Impressed by Joplin s talent and realizing his family s dire straits Weiss taught him free of charge He tutored the yearold Joplin until he was  during which time Weiss introduced him tofolk  and classical music including opera Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an art as well as an entertainment[]  and helped his mother acquire a used piano According to his wife Lottie Joplin never forgot Weiss and in his later years when he achieved fame as a composer sent his former teacher gifts of money when he was old and ill until Weiss died[]  At the age of  Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana playing piano In addition he taught guitar and mandolin[] Life in the Southern states and Chicago[edit ]In the late s having performed at various local events as a teenager Joplin chose to give up work as a laborer with the railroad and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician[]  Little is known about his movements at this time although he is recorded in Texarkana in July  as a member of theTexarkana Minstrels in a performance that happened to be raising money for a monument toJefferson Davis  President of the Southern Confederacy[]  He soon discovered however that there were few opportunities for black pianists Churches andbrothels  were among the few options for steady work Joplin played preragtime  jigpiano  in variousredlight districts  throughout the midSouth and some claim he was in Sedalia and St Louis during this time[] [] In  Joplin was in Chicago for the World s Fair  While in Chicago he formed his first band playingcornet  and began arranging music for the group to perform Although the World s Fair minimized the involvement of AfricanAmericans black performers still came to the saloons cafs and brothels that lined the fair The exposition was attended by  million Americans and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life including ragtime Although specific information is sparse numerous sources have credited the Chicago World Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime[]  Joplin found that his music as well as that of other black performers was popular with visitors[]  By  ragtime had become a national craze in American cities and was described by theSt Louis Dispatch as a veritable call of the wild which mightily stirred the pulses of city bred people[] Life in Missouri[edit ]A  recording of the Maple Leaf Rag by the United States Marine Band This is the first surviving recording of theMaple Leaf Rag  []  []

At first Joplin stayed with the family ofArthur Marshall  at the time a year old boy but later one of Joplin s students and a ragtime composer in his own right[]  There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until  as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician     Front cover of the third edition of the Maple Leaf Rag sheet music There is little precise evidence known about Joplin s activities at this time although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia theBlack  club and the Maple Leaf Club He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own sixpiece dance orchestra A tour with his own singing group the Texas Medley Quartet gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions and it is known that he went toSyracuse New York  and Texas Two businessmen from New York published Joplin s first two works the songsPlease Say You Will and A Picture of her Face in []  Joplin s visit toTemple Texas  enabled him to have three pieces published there in  including theGreat Crush Collision March  which commemorated aplanned train crash  on the MissouriKansasTexas Railroad  on September  that he may have witnessed The March was described by one of Joplin s biographers as a special early essay in ragtime[]  While in Sedalia he was teaching piano to students who included future ragtime composersArthur Marshall  Brun Campbell  and Scott Hayden []  In turn Joplin enrolled at theGeorge R Smith College  where he apparently studied advanced harmony and composition The College records were destroyed in a fire in []  and biographer Edward A Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for AfricanAmericans would be able to provide such a course[] [] [] In  Joplin married Belle the sisterinlaw of collaborator Scott Hayden  Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the Maple Leaf Rag was published Joplin was not far behind His first published ragOriginal Rags  had been completed in  the same year as the first ragtime work in print theMississippi Rag by William Krell  The Maple Leaf Rag was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in  Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around []  The exact circumstances that led to the Maple Leaf Rag s publication are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers Joplin signed a contract on August   withJohn Stillwell Stark  a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a  royalty on all sales of the rag with a minimum sales price of  cents[]  With the inscription To the Maple Leaf Club prominently visible along the top of at least some editions it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club although there is no direct evidence to prove the link and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time[]     Scott Joplin House  in St Louis Missouri  There have been many claims about the sales of theMaple Leaf Rag for example that Joplin was the first musician to sell  million copies of a piece of instrumental music[]  Joplin s first biographerRudi Blesh  wrote that during its first six months the piece sold  copies and became the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America[]  However research by Joplin s later biographer Edward A Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case the initial printrun of  took one year to sell and under the terms of Joplin s contract with a  royalty would have given Joplin an income of  or approximately at current prices Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses In  estimated sales would have given him an income of  annually approximately in current prices[] The Maple Leaf Rag did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers especially in the development of classic ragtime[]  After the publication of theMaple Leaf Rag Joplin was soon being described as King of rag time writers not least by himself[]  on the covers of his own work such asThe Easy Winners  and Elite Syncopations After the Joplins moved to St Louis  in early  they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth Joplin s relationship with his wife was difficult as she had no interest in music They eventually separated and then divorced[]  About this time Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags[]  It was in St Louis that Joplin produced some of his bestknown works includingThe Entertainer  March Majestic and the short theatrical work The Ragtime Dance In June  Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock Arkansas  the young woman to whom he had dedicatedThe Chrysanthemum She died on September   of complications resulting from a cold ten weeks after their wedding[]  Joplin s first work copyrighted after Freddie s death Bethena  was described by one biographer as an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtimewaltzes [] During this time Joplin created an opera company of  people and produced his first operaA Guest of Honor  for a national tour It is not certain how many productions were staged or even if this was an allblack show or a racially mixed production During the tour either inSpringfield Illinois  orPittsburg Kansas  someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts Joplin could not meet the company s payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house It is believed that the score forA Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of nonpayment of the company s boarding house bill[] Later years[edit ]     Front cover of the Wall Street Rag  sheet music In  Joplin moved to New York City which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera After his move to New York Joplin met Lottie Stokes whom he married in []  In  unable to find a publisher Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishingTreemonisha  himself in pianovocal format In  as a lastditch effort to see it performed he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall inHarlem  Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment it was a miserable failure to a public not ready for crude black musical formsso different from the European grand opera of that time[]  The audience including potential backers was indifferent and walked out[]  Scott writes that after a disastrous single performance  Joplin suffered a breakdown He was bankrupt discouraged and worn out He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles Treemonisha went unnoticed and unreviewed largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music a field closed to African Americans[]  In fact it was not until the s that the opera received a full theatrical stagingIn  Joplin and Lottie selfpublished his Magnetic Rag  as the Scott Joplin Music Company which he had formed the previous December[]  Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due tosyphilis  and was consciously racing against time In her sleeve notes on the Deutsche Grammophon  release of Treemonisha  she notes that he plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera day and night with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts page by page as each page of the full score was completed[] Death[edit ]By  Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilis  and a resulting descent into insanity[] []  In January  he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital  a mental institution[]  He died there on April  of syphilitic dementia at the age of [] []  and was buried in a pauper s grave that remained unmarked for  years His grave at Saint Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in []

music and Joplin s natural ability has been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended AfricanAmerican musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the sragtime [] When Joplin was learning the piano serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs cranked out by the tunesmiths ofTin Pan Alley []  As a composer Joplin refined ragtime elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the wandering honkytonk pianists playing mere dance music of popular imagination[]  This new art form the classic rag  combined AfroAmerican folk music ssyncopation  and thcentury European romanticism  with its harmonic schemes and its marchlike tempos[] []  In the words of one critic Ragtime was basically an AfroAmerican version of the polka or its analog theSousa style march[]  With this as a foundation Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them without improvisation[]  Joplin wrote his rags as classical music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its cheap bordello origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as  more tuneful contrapuntal infectious and harmonically colorful than any others of his era[] Some speculate that Joplin s achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacherJulius Weiss  who may have brought a polka  rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the year old Joplin[]  As Curtis put it The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware[] Joplin s first and most significant hit the Maple Leaf Rag was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least  years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns melody lines and harmony[]  though with the exception of Joseph Lamb  they generally failed to enlarge upon it[] Treemonisha[edit ]    Treemonisha    Main article Treemonisha  The opera s setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin s childhood town Texarkana in September  The plot centers on an year old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps  nest when her friend Remus rescues her The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader[] [] [] Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias ensembles and choruses In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident inTreemonisha are common in the operatic tradition and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composerRichard Wagner  of which Joplin was aware A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from inDie Walkre  and the retelling of the heroine s origins echos aspects of the operaSiegfried  In addition AfricanAmerican folk tales also influence the storythe wasp nest incident is similar to the story ofBr er Rabbit  and the briar patch[] Treemonisha is not a ragtime operabecause Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly using them to convey racial character and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the th century The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late th century recreated by a skilled and sensitive participant[] Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin s own life He notes that Lottie Joplin the composer s third wife saw a connection between the character Treemonisha s wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer In addition it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie Joplin s second wife because the date of the opera s setting was likely to have been the month of her birth[] At the time of the opera s publication in  the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as an entirely new form of operatic art[]  Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history with its heroine a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement[]  Curtis s conclusion is similar In the end Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy learning hard work and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race[]  Berlin describes it as a fine opera certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States but later states that Joplin s own libretto showed the composer was not a competent dramatist with the book not up to the quality of the music[] Performance skills[edit ]Pleasant Moments Ragtime Waltz played by Scott Joplin April   Sorry your browser either has JavaScript disabled or

Sedalia  newspaper in  and fellow ragtime composersArthur Marshall  and Joe Jordan  both said that he played the instrument well[]  However the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper rather than at the pianoArtie Matthews  recalled the delight the St Louis players took in outplaying Joplin[] While Joplin never made an audio recording his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls  for use in mechanical player pianos  All seven were made in  Of these the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing[]  probably by William Axtmann the staff arranger at Connorized[]  Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St Louis he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearlyall symptoms of thesyphilis  that took his life in []  Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of Maple Leaf Rag on the UniRecord label from June  as shocking disorganized and completely distressing to hear[]  While there is disagreement among pianoroll experts about the accuracy of the reproduction of a player s performance[] [] [] []  Berlin notes that the Maple Leaf Rag roll was painfully bad and likely to be the truest record of Joplin s playing at the time The roll however does not reflect his abilities earlier in life[] Legacy[edit ]     Nonpareil  Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes changing American musical taste Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties  Joplin s ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America[] Joshua Rifkin  a leading Joplin recording artist wrote A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work and even at his most highspirited he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity  He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him[]  Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety  Joplin did for the rag whatChopin  did for themazurka  His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated thebolero  and the tango []  Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin s music had helped to revolutionise American music and culture by removing Victorian restraint[] Composer and actor Max Morath  found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin s work did not enjoy the popularity of theMaple Leaf Rag because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his lifetime[]  Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin opined thatMaple Leaf Rag would make him  King of Ragtime Composers  but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime  When I m dead twentyfive years people are going to recognize me  he told a friend Just over thirty years later he was recognized and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin[] Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music And as a pioneer composer and performer he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of both races After his death jazz historian Floyd Levin noted Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers the man who gave America a genuine native music[] Revival[edit ]After his death in  Joplin s music and ragtime in general waned in popularity as new forms of musical styles such asjazz  and novelty piano  emerged Even so jazz bands and recording artists such asTommy Dorsey  in Jelly Roll Morton  in  and J Russell Robinson  in  released recordings of Joplin compositionsMaple Leaf Rag was the Joplin piece found most often on rpm  records[] In the s a smallscale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars such as Trebor TichenorWilliam Bolcom  William Albright  and Rudi Blesh  Audiophile Records  released a two record setThe Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin The Greatest of Ragtime Composers performed by Knocky Parker  in [] In  Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin  a young musicologist in the body of Joplin s work Together they hosted an occasional ragtimeandearlyjazz evening onWBAI  radio[]  In November  Rifkin released a recording calledScott Joplin Piano Rags []  on the classical  label Nonesuch  It sold  copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch s first millionselling record[]  The Billboard BestSelling Classical LPs chart for September   has the record at number  with the followup Volume  at number  and a combined set of both volumes at number  Separately both volumes had been on the chart for  weeks In the top  spots on that chart  of the entries were recordings of Joplin s work three of which were Rifkin s[]  Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section The album was nominated in  for twoGrammy Award  categories Best Album Notes  and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance without orchestra  Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin but at the ceremony on March   Rifkin did not win in any category[]  He did a tour in  which included appearances on BBC  Television and a sellout concert at London sRoyal Festival Hall []  In Alan Rich  in the New York Magazine  wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin s music on diskNonesuch Records  created almost alone the Scott Joplin revival[] In January  Harold C Schonberg  music critic at

RecordsMore Scott Joplin Rags in  and The Road From Rags To Jazz in In  film producer George Roy Hill  contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately asking each man to write the score for a film project he was working onThe Sting  Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments Instead Hill foundMarvin Hamlisch  available and brought him into the project as composer[]  Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin s music for theThe Sting for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation  on April  []  His version of The Entertainer reached number  on theBillboard Hot   and the American Top   music chart on May  [] []  prompting The New York Times  to write The whole nation has begun to take notice[]  Thanks to the film and its score Joplin s work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world becoming in the words of music magazineRecord World  the classical phenomenon of the decade[]  Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin s style and his band adaptations from Schuller s style[]  Schuller said Hamlisch got the Oscar for music he didn t write since it is by Joplin and arrangements he didn t write and  editions  he didn t make A lot of people were upset by that but that s show biz[] On October   excerpts from Treemonisha were presented in concert form atLincoln

2014-07-05 17:32:24 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex The Metro  by Josef Essberger  The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual  That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement  but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris   Yet there was clearly something strange about the case  It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification  for it was fully clothed and none of the owner s personal effects had been removed  save of course for his head  The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man s wallet with forensic evidence from the body  Added to that  Madame Charente  the dead man s wife  could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways   She had already reported her husband as missing    A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm  dark tunnels on either side of Od on station  where the body had been found  Above ground another search was made  equally fruitlessly  and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved   Two weeks later  four kilometres away in the west  a headless body was found at Courcelles station  again in the tunnel not far from the platform  As in the earlier case  the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head  which appeared to have been done with some precision  Again  the body was fully clothed and easily identified  and nothing but the head had apparently been removed    What can I tell these blessed reporters   Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home   They want answers for everything  And it s not just the papers now  the politicians are getting worried too  I m reporting to the Pr fet on this one     If there were instant answers for everything  mon petit chou  they d have no need of you   said Madame Dutruelle   And where would they be without you  Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year  and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot    The little inspecteur divisionnaire chef pulled in his stomach  puffed out his chest and rose to his full height  A smile spread across his round face  In his smart dark suit and gold rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris s most successful policemen    Just think   he said wryly   they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation     They re fools  all of them     All the same  my dear  I don t know where to go on this one  There re no leads  There s no apparent motive  And it s a bizarre pattern  Assuming  of course  it is a pattern  We can t be sure of that until there s been another    Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge  A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed    It s another one  sir   said the voice at the other end    Another what     It s identical  Another headless corpse  just like the others   male  middle aged  white     Where   asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette    Ch teau Rouge     In the Metro     Yes sir  just inside the tunnel  In the anti suicide well between the tracks     Close the line   if you haven t already  I ll be with you soon  And don t move it  d you hear    Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room    I hate these early morning cases   he muttered  He lit his cigarette    Have a coffee before you go  Another dead body will keep     But we ve closed the line  And it s the other side of town  my dear  North Paris     All the same    He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee  Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty six whose long  thin lipped face was framed by stern grey hair  Her strong  practical hands were country hands  and she had never got used to city life  She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyren es  Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again  Poor Agnes  She tried so hard to please him  How could she know that he longed to be free of her  How could she possibly know of Vololona  the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case  For him it had been love at first sight    And for me too  my darling   Vololona had been quick to agree  her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked   a veritable coup de foudre   She spoke French well  with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise  Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man  but he was careful to tell no one except Monsieur Ch baut  his closest friend  about the source of his happiness    I ve never felt like this before  Pierre  I m captivated by her   he said one evening when he took Monsieur Ch baut to see Vololona dancing   It was a rare experience  even for the jaded Monsieur Ch baut  In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar  Her black limbs lashed the air to the music  which was raw and sensual    You know  Pierre  in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful  Well  you know that already  There was always my work  and the children  and I was happy enough at home  It never occured to me to look at another woman  But something happened when I met Vololona  She showed me how to live  She showed me what real ecstasy is  Look at her  Pierre  Isn t she the most exquisite thing you ever saw  And she adores me  She s crazy about me  But why  I ask you  What can she see in me   three times her age  pot bellied  bald       married    Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows  He smiled proudly to himself  He knew exactly what was on their minds  Life was strange  he thought  and you could never tell  Some of them were young men  tall and handsome and virile  yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her   Monsieur Ch baut finished his whisky    I can see   he said   that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris   Monsieur Ch baut was a lawyer    You re a cynic  Pierre     And after thirty years in the force you re not     Personally  I believe her when she says she loves me  I just don t know why  Another whisky     Well  one thing s for sure  R gis  it can t go on like that  One way or another things ll come to a head  But I must agree  she s exquisite all right  Like an exquisite Venus fly trap  And at the germane moment  you know  those soft  succulent petals will close around you like a vice    The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend s unreasonable attitude    How can you say that   he snapped   When you haven t even spoken to her     But all women are the same  R gis  Don t you know that  You should be a lawyer  then you d know it  They can t help it  they re built that way  Believe me  it can t go on without something happening    Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing  Monsieur Ch baut could see he had touched a raw nerve  He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder    Look R gis  all I m saying is  be careful  you haven t got my experience    Of course  that was true  When it came to women few men had Monsieur Ch baut s experience  Or his luck  for that matter  He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties  He crossed roads without looking  He did not hurry for trains  He never reconciled bank accounts  Tall  slim  with boyish good looks and thick  black  wavy hair  he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle    Look  you ve got two women involved  R gis   Monsieur Ch baut continued   and women aren t like us  Agnes isn t stupid  She must know something s going on     She hasn t said anything   said the Inspector brusquely  He lit another Gauloise    Of course she hasn t  She s cleverer than you are  She intends to keep you     Mind you   said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly   she has had some odd dreams recently   so she says  About me and another woman  But anyway  she just laughs and says she can t believe it     But R gis  you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same     Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something  if only out of decency    Monsieur Ch baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips    No   he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector   never  you must never tell her   coute R gis  even if she did mention it  you must deny everything  Even if she caught the two of you in the act  you must deny it  You can only tell a woman there s another when you ve definitively made up your mind to leave her  and even then it may not be safe     So much for logic     It s no use looking for logic in women  R gis  I told you  they re not like men  In fact  I ve come to the conclusion that they re not even the same species as men  Men and women aren t like dog and bitch  they re more like dog and cat  C est bizarre  non  In any case  I do know you can t keep two women on the go without something happening  I don t know what  but something    Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Pr fecture de police  Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings  and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them  They wanted constantly to know more  So of course did Inspector Dutruelle    I assure you  gentlemen   he told a press conference   we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts  We are doing everything possible  You can tell your readers that wherever they are  we ll find them     Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers   asked one of the foreign reporters    So as we know which heads we re looking for   added a journalist from London   It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris  Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated  Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations  Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances  Even the beggars  who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages  had gone  And the few passengers who remained sat more long faced than ever  or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms   Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up  His mind  already excited over Vololona  was now in a turmoil  Vololona had suddenly  and tearfully  announced that she was pregnant  Then  having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy   but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic   she told him one day on the telephone   I thought you were going to ask me to marry you   Inspector Dutruelle was stunned    But you know I m married  ma ch rie   he said    I thought you d leave Agnes   she replied   I wanted to be with you  I wanted to share everything with you       my child       my life       my bed   Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing    But darling  we can still see each other     No  it s too painful  I love you too much    Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all  Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona  he longed to be with her  If only Agnes would leave him  And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already   the dinners  the presents  the apartment  Why did women have to possess you  It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took  until there was nothing left to give but yourself  Perhaps Pierre was right after all  when you thought about it   The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally  Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect  no leads  no motive  His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity   It appears   commented France Soir   that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer   The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector  and they felt leaderless and demoralised  It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact  that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common   their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart  and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them   Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport  and he especially did not like the Metro  It was cramped  smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times  and in the summer it was hot  You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station  It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro    I can t take much more of this  Marc  he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him   it s too hot  We ll get off at the next stop     That s Barbes Rochechouart  sir  We can change there     No  Marc  We can get out there  Someone else can take a sauna  I ve had enough  Anyway  we need to have a look around   Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow  He sounded irritable   God knows what it s like normally   he added   When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart    At least we can get through now   said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator    How d you mean   asked Inspector Dutruelle    Well  normally this station s packed   beggars  passengers  buskers  hawkers  plus all their tables and stalls  It s like a damn great fair and market rolled into one  You can get anything here  from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes   not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin     Oh  yes   said Inspector Dutruelle  vaguely   I remember   He passed a handkerchief across his brow again   At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle s hand  Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight  the Inspector read aloud    Professor Dhiakobli  Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life          He broke off in mid sentence with a snort    What a lot of mumbo jumbo  Headless chickens and voodoo magic     It may be mumbo jumbo to you  sir   said the Detective Constable with a laugh   but round here they take that sort of thing seriously  And not only round here   after all  we use some of these techniques in the police  don t we     Oh really  Such as     Well  graphology for a start   you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone s handwriting scientific  can you sir  Or what about astrology   employing people on the basis of the stars  Or numerology     Yes  Marc   said Inspector Dutruelle  pushing the card into his top pocket   maybe you re right  and maybe when you re older you won t be so sure  Now get on the blower and call the car    The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August  No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro  and the media  bored with the lack of developments  left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity  Paris  deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast  was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro  Then  in September  the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal   But Inspector Dutruelle s passion for Vololona did not cool with the season  Vololona had at last agreed to see him  occasionally  but she always managed  with tears in her eyes  to deflect his more amorous advances  For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment  but he was growing increasingly frustrated  The notion that she had another lover obsessed him  and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin  Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door  as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees  Now  denied the one thing here he wanted  the scene filled him with dismay  Money and music were in the air  Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways  Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini skirts hurried to work  Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon lit video clubs  Somewhere deep below ran the Metro  but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that  His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things  Sometimes he would stay all night  leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night s revelries  Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes  but he never once saw her on the arm of another man  or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor   One night  late in October  he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight  Madame Dutruelle  having been told that her husband was working on a case  and perhaps believing it  was already asleep  Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair  for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes  the sort of man who irons his shoelaces  But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor  Muttering to himself  the Inspector bent and picked it up  and as he did so something fell from the top pocket  He gazed at it blankly for a moment  Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station  a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners  but still legible  He picked it up and slowly started to read   PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life  luck  love  marriage  attraction of clients  examinations  sexual potency  If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another  this is his domain  you will be loved and your partner will return  Prof  Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog  He

B   th floor  door on left Metro  Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again   All problems resolved        It was preposterous  And yet  it was tempting  What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed  After all  everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it   Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris s eighteenth arrondissement  an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa  It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way  cursing because he had not brought his umbrella  The door to number   b was swinging in the wind  its dark paint peeling badly  He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth floor door on which a brass plaque read   Professor Dhiakobli Sp cialiste des travaux occultes Please ring   He stood there  breathing heavily from the stairs  and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared    Please enter  my dear sir   said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy   I am Dhiakobli  And I have the honour to meet           As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined  Professor Dhiakobli was black  He had a short yet commanding figure  and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit  A large  silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket    For the moment   said Inspector Dutruelle   my name is hardly important  I ve only come in response to your advertisement     Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help  A minor indiscretion  Please be seated  sir  and let us talk about the matter    Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large  well upholstered chair to which he had been directed  Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk  on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging  its wide  moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer    Ah  I see that Zeus approves of you   said the Professor  stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers  his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle   Poor Zeus  mon petit papillon  he is devoted to me  but he must remain here whenever I leave France  And you are fortunate  monsieur  It is only now that I return from C te d Ivoire  It is my country you know  I return there for a few months each summer  Paris in summer is so disagreeable  don t you agree    Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success  The frames of his glasses  the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left  the gem studded rings on his fingers   all were of gold  From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man  Around him the large room was like a shrine  Heavy curtains excluded the daylight  the only illumination was a small brass desklamp  and the dark  red walls were festooned with spears  costumes  photographs and other African memorabilia  There was a sweet smell in the air  and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator  You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris    As I say   began Inspector Dutruelle  ignoring the Professor s question   I saw your card and I wondered just how you work     And may one enquire as to monsieur s little difficulty    Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could    Well     he coughed again    first of all  I wondered what sort of things you can help people with    The Professor s eyebrows rose    Anything   he said slowly  his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin   My dear sir  anything at all     And then  I wondered  how do you operate  That s to say  what exactly do you do       and how do you charge     Ah monsieur  let us not talk of money  First I must learn just how I can help you  And for that a consultation is in order    Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat    And what would a consultation involve  What does it       cost    Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably    Mon cher monsieur  I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money  I too recoil at the mere thought of it  It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune  And if some donate a small token of their gratitude  who am I to refuse their offering  They pay according to their means  to assist those who have little to offer  But for a preliminary consultation  monsieur  a nominal sum  as a mark of good faith  is usually in order  For a gentleman of your obvious standing  a trifle  a mere two hundred francs  And let me assure you  monsieur  of my absolute discretion  Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls   He paused  Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin   They have the sanctity of the confessional     I m glad to hear it   said the Inspector    But monsieur still has the advantage of me        continued Professor Dhiakobli   Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking  He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier  a Parisien wine merchant  and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul  He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients  of their instant and passionate love for one another  of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him  and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave  Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits  end and now even his business was suffering  He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret  The Professor listened intently  asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments  Finally Inspector Dutruelle said   Well  Professor Dhiakobli  I think that s all I can tell you  I don t think I can tell you any more  From what I have told you  do you believe you can help me    For a long time there was silence  The Professor appeared to be in another world  He stared at Inspector Dutruelle  but seemed to be looking through him    My dear Monsieur Mazodier   he said at last  very slowly  almost mechanically   the story you have told me is most poignant  Each of us has a hidden corner in his life  a jardin secret  Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours  Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women  At the mercy of their complex physical structure  is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures  I help them find their lost ones  their partners of many years  to recreate again the rapport of their youth  You will understand that it is not easy  But this is my work  My domain     So you can t help me   said Inspector Dutruelle  adding despondently   Perhaps what I really need is a head shrink    The Professor gave a start  Again  for a long time he did not answer  Then his teeth flashed in the dimness     coutez monsieur  this is my work  my domain   he repeated   Certainly I can help you  But you must understand that it will not be easy  It calls for a special ceremony  In the first place  you are married  and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women  In the second  we are both men of the world  monsieur  and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages  And finally  it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic  You know  the magic of Madagascar is very strong  No  monsieur  it will not be easy  Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone  Sometimes        He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye  his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant   Sometimes   he said   we must make sacrifices     What sort of sacrifices   asked Inspector Dutruelle dully    Oh  my dear sir  you must leave that to me  But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs   His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath   You must not concern yourself with technicalities  monsieur  Your mind must be fixed on the future  on the life you have dreamed of  You must envisage your wife   happy in the arms of another  You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for       secure in your arms       sharing your life       your days       your nights  The perfect solution to all your problems  Is it not worth a considerable sum     It certainly would be worth a lot        Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor s words came to life in his mind    Shall we say thirty thousand francs     I m sorry   muttered the Inspector    Let s say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards   the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken   Do you see  monsieur  how confident I am of success    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was confused  He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt  or to propose quite so generous a token  But it did not seem to matter  After all  what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately  And  in any case  at worst it was only fifteen thousand   The Professor s eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle    Of course  monsieur  I have faith in your gratitude  I know that you will not forget  in your delight  that what I have done  I can undo  And now  monsieur  you must not allow me to detain you further  We have much work to do  In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy  And with some little articles of clothing  something close to their thoughts  say a scarf or a hat  You can arrange this    Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly    Excellent  monsieur  I must know them in every detail   if I am to have a spiritual t te   t te with each of them  So  in fifteen days  you will return for the ceremony  It will take place beyond those curtains  in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits  Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there  but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day  It must be at dawn  and you must come without fail   the ceremony cannot be deferred  Can you manage six in the morning  shall we say Monday the sixteenth    Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December  At four o clock in the morning he got out of bed  Though his wife stirred she did not wake  He showered and dressed  His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen  boiling water for his coffee  He drank two cups  strong and black  but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam  He lit a Gauloise and paced the room  Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing  finishing his cigarette  Below him the courtyard was dark and silent  and above him the sky was black  But away in the east  through the open end of the court  a violet hue was creeping over Paris  He glanced at his watch  It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car  It would seem strange  leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver  He wondered what the concierge would make of it all   she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor  He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut   Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything  He looked into the bedroom  Gently  he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept  her arms clasped about her knees  He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek  Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him  switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen  and opened the front door  As he did so the telephone rang  It startled him and he cursed aloud  He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake    Inspector Dutruelle   said the voice at the other end    Yes  what is it     Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning  Monsieur l Inspecteur  It s the Pr fecture     Never mind the time   said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey   I m off duty today     Well  that s the point  Inspector  The Pr fet s ordered us to call you specially  He appreciates you re not on duty  but he wants you anyway     It s quite impossible     I m afraid he insists  sir     Why     He insists you come on duty immediately  sir  We re sending a car round for you     Yes  yes  I understand  but why     It s the Metro again  sir     The Metro     Yes  sir  They ve found another corpse on the line  decapitated again    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was cursing to himself  He was cursing the Pr fet  the police  this homicidal maniac  his wife  Why today  Why ever today    Sir  Hello sir  The car ll be with you in five minutes     Yes  all right  I ll be ready in five minutes    The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf  Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine  His dreams  it seemed  were evaporating just as surely    You d better brief me on this as quick as you can   he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car   Where was the body found     Barbes Rochechouart  sir    A cold shiver passed through the Inspector    I presume it s the same as the others   he asked    Well  in as much as there s nothing to go on  it s the same  sir  Otherwise it couldn t be more different  For a start  we ve just heard they ve found two of them now  And this time they re women  One white  in her forties  and one black  A young black girl   still in her teens  by the look of things    But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening  He was staring blankly through the glass to his right  and as they turned at Place du Ch telet the empty streets were no more than a cold  grey blur to him  The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de S bastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart  It was the route he should have been taking in his own car   Outside the station  now closed to passengers  people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up  Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car  He hesitated  He glanced towards Rue Beldamme  just a stone s throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart  where the Professor would be waiting for him  He shrugged and went down the station steps   Underground  on the number four line  there was an air of gloom  Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train drivers through that morning  Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one  It was the body of a middle aged woman  quite unexceptional  coarse and wiry  like his wife    She s forty seven  Monsieur l Inspecteur   said somebody beside him   French  Name of Madame Catherine Dubur  Not like the other one     The other one   said the Inspector blankly    I told you in the car  sir   said the Detective Sergeant at his ear   there s two of them     You d better show me    They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track  A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body  which lay on its back  Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff  black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines  Suddenly he shuddered in alarm  Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona    Identity   he asked  He tried to control his voice    We don t know  sir   this is all we found   said a policeman  handing him a tattered greetings card  Inside  in large  green handwriting  were the words   Happy Nineteenth Birthday  from Everyone in Antananarivo     D you think she s Malagasy  sir   asked the policeman  The Inspector shrugged his shoulders  then held out an open hand    Your torch  please   he said   He played its beam over the body  up and down the long  slender legs  across the clothes  At least he did not recognise the clothes  Yet the body s size  its build  its colour  everything pointed to Vololona  He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him  He stood up in relief  That was certainly not Vololona  Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her   and the other of Agnes  for that matter  Even the ages were the same   He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse  He could not understand  Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere  And what of Agnes  How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that  How could he explain it  when you came to think of it  When you came to think of it  he had explained very little  He had been happy enough to take the money  and free enough with his words   all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual t te   t tes        Inspector Dutruelle gasped    The devil   he muttered to himself  Suddenly he understood everything    The what  sir   said somebody beside him    Never mind   he answered quietly  putting his hand to his breast pocket  His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions  He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise  Through its curling blue smoke  back lit by the lights of the train  the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance  while beside him men s voices were thrumming in his ear  Why was there no time to think  to extricate himself from this nightmare  He cursed himself  How could he have been so stupid  He cursed his wife and Vololona  And Professor Dhiakobli  What madness had driven him to this  Then he cursed himself again  and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side    What time is it     Six fifteen  sir    For a moment  he hesitated  Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body     coute Guy  when he s got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up   he said   Now get me the Pr fet    The Pr fet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep  and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation    Are you insane  man  You re in the middle of an investigation     The investigation is over  Monsieur le Pr fet     So  you have the killer at last     In fifteen minutes  monsieur  in fifteen minutes     Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty

units who require prolonged care after an acute illness Predicting use of these facilities may help hospitals improve resource management expenditures and quality of care delivered in intensive careObjective To develop a predictive tool for early identification of intensive care patients with increased probability of transfer to such a hospitalMethods Data on  adults admitted to intensive care at a tertiary care hospital between January  and June  were retrospectively reviewed The prediction model was developed by using multiple ordinal logistic regression The model was internally validated via the bootstrapping technique and externally validated with a control cohort of  intensive care patientsResults Among the study group  patients  were discharged to longterm acute care hospitals and   to home or other care facilities   died in the intensive care unit The final prediction algorithm showed good accuracy biascorrected concordance index   CI  excellent calibration and external validation concordance index   CI  Hypoalbuminemia was the greatest potential driver of increased likelihood of discharge to a longterm acute care hospital Other important predictors were intensive care unit category older age extended hospital stay before admission to intensive care severe pressure ulcers admission source and dependency on mechanical ventilationConclusions This new predictive tool can help estimate on the first day of admission to intensive care the likelihood of a patients discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalThe economic impact of and demand for critical care services in the United States are intensifying From  to  annual critical care expenditures increased from  billion to  billion  In  critical care services accounted for approximately  of national health care expenditures and  of the US gross domestic product  Part of the increased costs and demand for intensive care unit ICU services are due to a subgroup of critically ill patients who survive acute illness and require prolonged lifesupport care   These patients also termed chronically critically ill represent a problem of growing importance Chronically critically ill patients account for only  to  of all ICU admissions but for approximately  of total ICU expenditures   The increasing costs and demand for critical care services in the United States have resulted in greater emphasis on efficient ICU resource management and improvement in quality of care    Development of care practices for chronically critically ill patients is a considerable challenge not only for ICU clinicians but also for the health system as a whole  Changes in reimbursement and the continued increase in the number of chronically critically ill patients have increased pressures on acute care hospitals to reduce the length of stay and cost of care  Longterm acute care hospitals LTACHs are facilities that have recently emerged in response to the demand for prolonged care after an acute illness  These facilities offer multiple benefits to patients and acute care hospitals including reduction of underreimbursed costs more efficient ICU bed procurement and improvement of benchmarking measurements     As a result the utilization and number of LTACHs have been increasing at a high rate Our primary objective in this study was to develop a predictive algorithm for early identification of ICU patients with a high probability of discharge to an LTACH We hypothesized that sufficient accuracy could be achieved by using predictor variables that were available within the first  hours of ICU admission Formerly no such predictive instrument has existed Although experienced ICU clinicians may use various clinical characteristics and laboratory results to estimate the future need for LTACH transfer this clinical assessment can be influenced by multiple biases  A predictive tool permits the clinical care team to make decisions based on and supported by objective data rather than subjective intuition Individualized prediction of discharge to an LTACH may allow for strategic planning to improve ICU resource management and quality of care In addition early and objective identification of ICU patients with the greatest likelihood of LTACH transfer could facilitate LTACH referrals encourage preparation of patients and their families and decrease financial issues for the patients and the hospitalsIncreased costs for ICU services come in part from the chronically critically illPrevious Section  Next Section  MethodsSample SelectionThis retrospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center with  adult ICU beds Approval was granted by the appropriate institutional review board informed consent was not required Data for development of the model were obtained from the medical records of  patients  years or older who had been admitted to an ICU between January  and June VariablesA team of clinicians and research staff developed a list of  demographic ICU admission and medical variables that they thought had empirical or theoretical relevance to discharge to an LTACH seeTable  Demographic variables included age sex and body mass index ICU admission was summarized by  variables length of stay before ICU admission source of admission ICU category and type of ICU admission Length of stay before ICU admission was defined as the number of days the patient stayed in the hospital directly before being admitted to the ICU Source of admission was the site from which the patient was transferred to the ICU  the emergency department  the hospital unit or operating room or  a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or an other hospital ICU category was defined as the admitting ICU cardiovascular coronary heart failure medical neurosurgical surgical Type of ICU admission indicated whether or not the admission was planned or anticipated by the care team ie discussed in notes before the admission or treatment intervention The remaining  physiological and laboratory variables were measures of medical status during the first  hours of ICU admission The response variable discharge disposition was collapsed into  categories LTACH home or other care facilities ie nonLTACH and death in the ICU Other care facilities encompassed skilled nursing facilities as well as acute and chronic rehabilitation facilitiesView this table   In this window    In a new window  Table Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis of model development cohortStatistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version  SAS Institute Inc and R statistical software version  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Univariate analyses to compare the LTACH group with the nonLTACH and ICUdeath groups were performed by using the MannWhitney test Pearson  test or Fisher exact test as appropriate Differences were considered significant atP   With all  established variables see Table  a multiple ordinal logistic regression model was developed to predict the outcome of LTACH discharge A simultaneous approach ie all variables entered at a single step was implemented rather than a stepwise procedure for analysis as recommended by Harrell et al  Missing data in the development cohort were estimated by using themice multivariate imputation by chained equations function in R statistical software generating several imputations by using Gibbs sampling  The coefficients from the resulting multiple logistic regression model were used to construct a paperbased graphic calculation tool called a nomogram by using the design library of R statistical software Points for each predictor were determined by rescaling the regression coefficients to adapt to a userfriendly point scale Variable importance in the final model was ascertained from the relative potential contribution of points as deduced from the nomogram and the length of the axis Variables with longer axes have greater potential predictive effect in the modelInternal validation of the model with the original development data was determined by using the bootstrapping technique to correct for overfitting bias  During this process a random bootstrap sample of the original data was generated from the cohort and the model was applied to this sample to yield predicted results  This technique was repeated  times to obtain a biascorrected estimate of the models predictive accuracy Discrimination of the model was quantified by using the concordance index ie the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve The concordance index ranges from  random discrimination to  perfect discrimination and represents the ability of the model to accurately assign a higher probability to the patient discharged to LTACH for a randomly selected pair of patients with one discharged to LTACH and the other not Typically predictive tests are considered of clinical value when the concordance index is greater than    Calibration an additional measure of model performance illustrates how well the models predictions agree with the observed outcomes Calibration was assessed graphically by plotting predicted vs actual probabilities for discharge to LTACH A model with perfect predictions generates a calibration curve that lies on the  lineTwentyone variables that had empirical or theoretical relevance to longterm acute care were usedThe predictive tool was externally validated with an independent cohort of  ICU patients at the same institution admitted between January  and March  The sample size of the validation cohort was estimated to provide greater than  statistical power to conclude a concordance index of the validation data set assumed to be approximately  on the basis of the data for the development cohort is significantly greater than  Discrimination of the model on the external validation sample was quantified with the concordance index and calibration was assessed graphicallyUsing the nomogram Figure   to calculate the predicted probability of LTACH discharge requires the following steps  locate the patients category or value on the axis corresponding to the respective predictor variable  draw a vertical line upward to the points axis to determine how many points are assigned for that characteristic in the model  repeat this process for the remaining predictor variable axes determining the points for each predictor independently  sum the points achieved for all predictors  locate this summed point value on the total points axis and draw a vertical line down to the probability axis to calculate the patients predicted probability of having the models primary end point ie discharge to an LTACH  View larger version   In this window    In a new window  Figure  Nomogram for discharge to a longterm

were discharged home or to other care facilities   died in the ICU The median ICU length of stay for patients transferred to an LTACH was  days thth percentile [interquartile range]  days Conversely patients discharged home or to other care facilities had a median ICU length of stay of  days interquartile range  days P   and patients who died in the ICU had a median ICU length of stay of  days before death interquartile range  days P   Of note the percentage of extended ICU stays ie  days among the LTACH discharge group   of  patients was significantly greater P   than the percentage among the other discharge groups home or other care facilities   of  patients death in the ICU   of  patients emphasizing the disparity in hospital resources required by an LTACH discharge patient TheTable

extreme values of PaO serum levels of creatinine or total bilirubin or platelet count contribute any meaningful amounts to the predicted risk Sex and requirements for dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine during the first  hours of ICU admission have minor impacts on the prediction of discharge to an LTACH ie contributed a relatively small number of points to the nomogram total score

validation data setPrevious Section  Next Section  DiscussionWe used demographic ICU admission and ICU clinical data measured during the first  hours of ICU admission to construct and validate a predictive model for estimating future use of an LTACH The models discrimination and calibration in the development and validation cohorts indicate it makes it possible to accurately predict the likelihood of LTACH use among ICU patients The most potentially influential determinants of this outcome included hypoalbuminemia ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU older age extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission presence of severe pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early requirement for mechanical ventilation These findings confirm and extend those of previous investigations   which have shown that in addition to dependency on mechanical ventilation older age and greater severity of illness other considerations are important for assessing disposition of discharge from an ICUThe model shows a strong direct association between hypoalbuminemia and the likelihood of discharge to an LTACH This finding may be explained by the underlying nutritional status hepatic failure cirrhosis andor acute response to stress or sepsis among critically ill patients   Several studies   have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased mortality morbidity ICU length of stay and resource utilization in critically ill patients Scheinhorn et al  found that hypoalbuminemia was common among patients admitted to an LTACH and previous investigators   emphasized its importance in predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation and chronic critical illness ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU contribute substantial points to the models predicted risk for discharge to an LTACH This result most likely occurs because these noncardiovascular ICUs typically receive more unplanned critically ill ICU patients than does a cardiovascular ICU A majority of cardiovascular ICU admissions  in a cardiovascular ICU vs  in all other ICUs are planned temporary eg  hours ICU transfers immediately after surgery as a monitoring precaution before the patient is moved to a stepdown unit Finally the predictive value of deepwound pressure ulceration within the LTACH discharge model is supported by the results of other investigations    The frequency of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients is a result of multiple comorbid conditions inability to move impaired angiogenesis response and dependency on mechanical ventilation  Our results suggest that stage  or higher pressure ulcers early in the ICU admission are associated with a higher likelihood of discharge to an LTACHOur findings are especially relevant because of the current initiatives to improve care practices for patients who are chronically critically ill      Early identification of LTACH use may allow clinical care teams to make appropriate arrangements for patients care after discharge from the ICU improve the transition of care ensure bed availability and avoid potential delays in patients discharge As emphasized by Zimmerman et al  discharge planning started shortly after ICU admission allows for more efficient use of ICU resources Enhanced ICU bed utilization has a variety of clinical implications including potentially better outcomes and farreaching financial value Older age presence of severe pressure ulcers early mechanical ventilation are also predictors of discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalLTACHs may improve outcomes for chronically critically ill patients through specialized care These hospitals often embrace a multidisciplinary and rehabilitationbased approach to treatment providing a setting with experienced health professionals and ample clinical resources for the care of patients who are chronically critically ill     Votto et al  reported that the clinical outcomes including inhospital mortality and discharges to home were significantly better for patients transferred to an LTACH than for similar patients who remained in acute care hospitals Furthermore patients treated at an LTACH are less likely to be readmitted to an acute care hospital than are those treated in alternative care settings after discharge from an ICU In addition to potential clinical benefits financial advantages may exist that support the use of LTACHs for chronically critically ill patients Cost reduction by LTACHs has been achieved by focusing on efficient staff operation and incorporation of care protocols as well as service and resource standardization  Votto et al  compared costs between LTACHeligible patients transferred and not transferred to an LTACH and concluded that the mean total cost per patient at an LTACH   was less than that at an acute care hospital  In a study  of critically ill patients with tracheostomies total Medicare expenses related to the admission ie acute and postacute care were less for patients in an LTACH than for patients in other settings Conversely results of a study  examining Medicare claims for a variety of patient types indicated that although patients transferred to an LTACH had decreased costs in the acute setting their total cost of care was higher than that of patients discharged to other postacute care facilities eg skilled nursing facility rehabilitation facility Although evidence     indicates that LTACH utilization results in considerable cost savings for acute care hospitals the economic impact of LTACH facilities on US health care expenditures is still undeterminedUnfortunately evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of LTACH utilization to treat patients with longterm illnesses The current interpretation is primarily based on retrospective studies which may introduce multiple biases The economic impact of LTACH utilization and whether these facilities actually help improve the longterm outcomes of chronically critically ill patients must be properly evaluated If compelling evidence supports therapeutic benefits of LTACH usage implementation of interventions designed to discharge chronically critically ill patients to an LTACH would be a safe approach to providing critical care services in a costeffective wayOur study has some notable limitations Our development and validation cohorts were patients admitted to a single tertiary care institution a situation that may limit the applicability of the results In addition the retrospective design may have introduced ascertainment bias The study design also restricted our analysis to data contained within the electronic health records preventing us from including other factors known to influence LTACH utilization such as payer source patient and clinician preference LTACH discharge criteria bed availability and geographic limitations  Previous Section  Next Section  ConclusionsThis study was our first effort at developing a clinical instrument to predict early in a patients ICU admission the probability of that patients discharge to an LTACH We think that this predictive tool offers a valuable perspective for patients patients family members clinicians and hospitals When complemented by the clinicians judgment as well as feedback from patients and their family members this risk calculator has the potential to improve the quality of care delivered to chronically critically ill patients while enhancing ICU resource managementPrevious Section  Next

2014-07-05 17:32:26 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex   How to Avoid Burnout Are You Falling for This Myth   You want to earn a spot in your niche with your incredible range of insights and experience  So you work diligently by squeezing content creation in between meetings  calls  emails  professional projects  home projects  family time  and much more   You think you’re on a great track and you’ll never burn out as long as you keep up your momentum   Eventually  you start to stay a little later working on projects and even work on weekends  You begin worrying about whether it’s working or if you should hedge your bets with this whole writing thing    Never mind   you say  You still hold on to the idea that you will never burn out   giving up and in to burnout is for idle  non dedicated people who don’t share your vision or passion  Short of an uncontrollable disaster  all you have to do is keep up this momentum and your hard work will pay off in the end   right  Wrong   A Seemingly Never Ending Balancing Act  That phrase you keep repeating   I’ll never burn out   is a myth  This busywork that’s masquerading as  dedication  is the road to burnout  How do you know   Do any of the following statements apply to you        Bad  days are more frequent than good      Most of your time is spent on tasks that seem impossible or are monotonous      You’re exhausted   if not all of the time  most of the time      You don’t feel appreciated or what you do makes a difference      You feel unmotivated   you can’t see value in caring about your work or even home life      You’re overwhelmed by venturing into a new territory      You feel like you’re going nowhere   If none of these apply to you  feel free to skip to the end and share your secrets to burnout prevention  If any of these apply to you  even in the slightest increment  then you’re showing signs of burnout  In turn  this could be negatively affecting your ability to accomplish your goals and have serious physical repercussions  The time is now to deal with it because you have a lot to lose if burnout gets the best of you   It’s Time for a Time Out  To address and prevent burnout  you need to stop and take a step back  Consider not only how you got there  but how you will bail yourself out to replenish your energy to accomplish your greater goals  Use these tips       Take a break        I can’t slow down   I have all of these things to do   Once you’ve reached burnout status  it’s hard to break habits that either serve little value or perpetuate the burnout balancing act  Slow down  This isn’t a request  Do it  Where you can  cut back on commitments that show little value and ask for help or delegate tasks  such as asking someone to proofread your content for you or even consider hiring a ghostwriter or transcriber  You cannot accomplish everything at once and deliver quality  Give yourself some time to recharge both your mind and body       Reevaluate your goals and priorities        I don’t even know where to begin    Here’s an exercise to get you started       Break down your obligations  duties  and tasks into two columns  In the first column  write all of those things people are depending on you to accomplish or what can only be done by you  In the second column  write down those things you do that could be done by someone else or reasonably eliminated altogether       Think of each item in your second column to be your  burnout relief  to do list by delegating these tasks or jettisoning them from your routine if they lack value       Next  write down your goals   personal  home  writing  and work goals that will create value in your life and work  Compare your goals to your first column  Is there anything that you can move over to the second column  Allow your goals to be the ruler that helps you measure your tasks and commitments   if it doesn’t measure up  delegate or eliminate it       For all commitments and tasks that remain in the first column  create a plan       Have a plan and rekindle your motivation        A goal is just a wish without a plan   Whatever type of plan you choose to implement   whether it targets your personal  professional  or writing goals   make sure it contains at least these three elements          It targets a specific goal          It’s broken into actionable steps          It’s rewarding   What I Do to Prevent Burnout  I’m S M A R T    that is  I plan S M A R T  goals by asking myself the following questions       Specific  What do I want to accomplish and what are its requirements or constraints      Measurable  What are the indicators I use to measure its success or achievement      Achievable  What are the steps I will take to accomplish this goal      Relevant  Is it worthwhile      Timely  What milestones should I meet or when will it be finally accomplished   Another strategy I’m a huge fan of is the to do list   daily lists  project lists  writing lists  shopping lists  activity lists  and honey do lists  a list for my husband      anything can chunked into a list  Call me peculiar  but I find an indescribable satisfaction in checking off each item as I finish it  which creates a powerful momentum that propels me through each task  For tasks I didn’t plan for and do  I’ll add it to my list  after the fact  to cross it off   Don’t wait  When you’re burned out  anything and everything can be a bear to handle  Change your course  Own your plan  Wear it out like a pair of running shoes until you can see through the soles because of all of the mileage you got

2014-07-05 17:32:26 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex The Metro  by Josef Essberger  The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual  That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement  but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris   Yet there was clearly something strange about the case  It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification  for it was fully clothed and none of the owner s personal effects had been removed  save of course for his head  The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man s wallet with forensic evidence from the body  Added to that  Madame Charente  the dead man s wife  could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways   She had already reported her husband as missing    A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm  dark tunnels on either side of Od on station  where the body had been found  Above ground another search was made  equally fruitlessly  and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved   Two weeks later  four kilometres away in the west  a headless body was found at Courcelles station  again in the tunnel not far from the platform  As in the earlier case  the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head  which appeared to have been done with some precision  Again  the body was fully clothed and easily identified  and nothing but the head had apparently been removed    What can I tell these blessed reporters   Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home   They want answers for everything  And it s not just the papers now  the politicians are getting worried too  I m reporting to the Pr fet on this one     If there were instant answers for everything  mon petit chou  they d have no need of you   said Madame Dutruelle   And where would they be without you  Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year  and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot    The little inspecteur divisionnaire chef pulled in his stomach  puffed out his chest and rose to his full height  A smile spread across his round face  In his smart dark suit and gold rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris s most successful policemen    Just think   he said wryly   they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation     They re fools  all of them     All the same  my dear  I don t know where to go on this one  There re no leads  There s no apparent motive  And it s a bizarre pattern  Assuming  of course  it is a pattern  We can t be sure of that until there s been another    Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge  A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed    It s another one  sir   said the voice at the other end    Another what     It s identical  Another headless corpse  just like the others   male  middle aged  white     Where   asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette    Ch teau Rouge     In the Metro     Yes sir  just inside the tunnel  In the anti suicide well between the tracks     Close the line   if you haven t already  I ll be with you soon  And don t move it  d you hear    Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room    I hate these early morning cases   he muttered  He lit his cigarette    Have a coffee before you go  Another dead body will keep     But we ve closed the line  And it s the other side of town  my dear  North Paris     All the same    He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee  Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty six whose long  thin lipped face was framed by stern grey hair  Her strong  practical hands were country hands  and she had never got used to city life  She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyren es  Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again  Poor Agnes  She tried so hard to please him  How could she know that he longed to be free of her  How could she possibly know of Vololona  the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case  For him it had been love at first sight    And for me too  my darling   Vololona had been quick to agree  her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked   a veritable coup de foudre   She spoke French well  with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise  Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man  but he was careful to tell no one except Monsieur Ch baut  his closest friend  about the source of his happiness    I ve never felt like this before  Pierre  I m captivated by her   he said one evening when he took Monsieur Ch baut to see Vololona dancing   It was a rare experience  even for the jaded Monsieur Ch baut  In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar  Her black limbs lashed the air to the music  which was raw and sensual    You know  Pierre  in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful  Well  you know that already  There was always my work  and the children  and I was happy enough at home  It never occured to me to look at another woman  But something happened when I met Vololona  She showed me how to live  She showed me what real ecstasy is  Look at her  Pierre  Isn t she the most exquisite thing you ever saw  And she adores me  She s crazy about me  But why  I ask you  What can she see in me   three times her age  pot bellied  bald       married    Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows  He smiled proudly to himself  He knew exactly what was on their minds  Life was strange  he thought  and you could never tell  Some of them were young men  tall and handsome and virile  yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her   Monsieur Ch baut finished his whisky    I can see   he said   that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris   Monsieur Ch baut was a lawyer    You re a cynic  Pierre     And after thirty years in the force you re not     Personally  I believe her when she says she loves me  I just don t know why  Another whisky     Well  one thing s for sure  R gis  it can t go on like that  One way or another things ll come to a head  But I must agree  she s exquisite all right  Like an exquisite Venus fly trap  And at the germane moment  you know  those soft  succulent petals will close around you like a vice    The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend s unreasonable attitude    How can you say that   he snapped   When you haven t even spoken to her     But all women are the same  R gis  Don t you know that  You should be a lawyer  then you d know it  They can t help it  they re built that way  Believe me  it can t go on without something happening    Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing  Monsieur Ch baut could see he had touched a raw nerve  He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder    Look R gis  all I m saying is  be careful  you haven t got my experience    Of course  that was true  When it came to women few men had Monsieur Ch baut s experience  Or his luck  for that matter  He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties  He crossed roads without looking  He did not hurry for trains  He never reconciled bank accounts  Tall  slim  with boyish good looks and thick  black  wavy hair  he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle    Look  you ve got two women involved  R gis   Monsieur Ch baut continued   and women aren t like us  Agnes isn t stupid  She must know something s going on     She hasn t said anything   said the Inspector brusquely  He lit another Gauloise    Of course she hasn t  She s cleverer than you are  She intends to keep you     Mind you   said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly   she has had some odd dreams recently   so she says  About me and another woman  But anyway  she just laughs and says she can t believe it     But R gis  you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same     Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something  if only out of decency    Monsieur Ch baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips    No   he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector   never  you must never tell her   coute R gis  even if she did mention it  you must deny everything  Even if she caught the two of you in the act  you must deny it  You can only tell a woman there s another when you ve definitively made up your mind to leave her  and even then it may not be safe     So much for logic     It s no use looking for logic in women  R gis  I told you  they re not like men  In fact  I ve come to the conclusion that they re not even the same species as men  Men and women aren t like dog and bitch  they re more like dog and cat  C est bizarre  non  In any case  I do know you can t keep two women on the go without something happening  I don t know what  but something    Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Pr fecture de police  Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings  and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them  They wanted constantly to know more  So of course did Inspector Dutruelle    I assure you  gentlemen   he told a press conference   we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts  We are doing everything possible  You can tell your readers that wherever they are  we ll find them     Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers   asked one of the foreign reporters    So as we know which heads we re looking for   added a journalist from London   It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris  Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated  Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations  Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances  Even the beggars  who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages  had gone  And the few passengers who remained sat more long faced than ever  or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms   Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up  His mind  already excited over Vololona  was now in a turmoil  Vololona had suddenly  and tearfully  announced that she was pregnant  Then  having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy   but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic   she told him one day on the telephone   I thought you were going to ask me to marry you   Inspector Dutruelle was stunned    But you know I m married  ma ch rie   he said    I thought you d leave Agnes   she replied   I wanted to be with you  I wanted to share everything with you       my child       my life       my bed   Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing    But darling  we can still see each other     No  it s too painful  I love you too much    Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all  Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona  he longed to be with her  If only Agnes would leave him  And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already   the dinners  the presents  the apartment  Why did women have to possess you  It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took  until there was nothing left to give but yourself  Perhaps Pierre was right after all  when you thought about it   The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally  Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect  no leads  no motive  His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity   It appears   commented France Soir   that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer   The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector  and they felt leaderless and demoralised  It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact  that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common   their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart  and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them   Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport  and he especially did not like the Metro  It was cramped  smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times  and in the summer it was hot  You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station  It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro    I can t take much more of this  Marc  he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him   it s too hot  We ll get off at the next stop     That s Barbes Rochechouart  sir  We can change there     No  Marc  We can get out there  Someone else can take a sauna  I ve had enough  Anyway  we need to have a look around   Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow  He sounded irritable   God knows what it s like normally   he added   When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart    At least we can get through now   said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator    How d you mean   asked Inspector Dutruelle    Well  normally this station s packed   beggars  passengers  buskers  hawkers  plus all their tables and stalls  It s like a damn great fair and market rolled into one  You can get anything here  from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes   not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin     Oh  yes   said Inspector Dutruelle  vaguely   I remember   He passed a handkerchief across his brow again   At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle s hand  Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight  the Inspector read aloud    Professor Dhiakobli  Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life          He broke off in mid sentence with a snort    What a lot of mumbo jumbo  Headless chickens and voodoo magic     It may be mumbo jumbo to you  sir   said the Detective Constable with a laugh   but round here they take that sort of thing seriously  And not only round here   after all  we use some of these techniques in the police  don t we     Oh really  Such as     Well  graphology for a start   you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone s handwriting scientific  can you sir  Or what about astrology   employing people on the basis of the stars  Or numerology     Yes  Marc   said Inspector Dutruelle  pushing the card into his top pocket   maybe you re right  and maybe when you re older you won t be so sure  Now get on the blower and call the car    The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August  No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro  and the media  bored with the lack of developments  left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity  Paris  deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast  was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro  Then  in September  the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal   But Inspector Dutruelle s passion for Vololona did not cool with the season  Vololona had at last agreed to see him  occasionally  but she always managed  with tears in her eyes  to deflect his more amorous advances  For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment  but he was growing increasingly frustrated  The notion that she had another lover obsessed him  and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin  Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door  as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees  Now  denied the one thing here he wanted  the scene filled him with dismay  Money and music were in the air  Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways  Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini skirts hurried to work  Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon lit video clubs  Somewhere deep below ran the Metro  but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that  His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things  Sometimes he would stay all night  leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night s revelries  Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes  but he never once saw her on the arm of another man  or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor   One night  late in October  he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight  Madame Dutruelle  having been told that her husband was working on a case  and perhaps believing it  was already asleep  Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair  for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes  the sort of man who irons his shoelaces  But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor  Muttering to himself  the Inspector bent and picked it up  and as he did so something fell from the top pocket  He gazed at it blankly for a moment  Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station  a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners  but still legible  He picked it up and slowly started to read   PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life  luck  love  marriage  attraction of clients  examinations  sexual potency  If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another  this is his domain  you will be loved and your partner will return  Prof  Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog  He will create between you a perfect rapport on the basis of love  All problems resolved  even desperate cases  Every day from  am to  pm  Payment after results    b  rue Beldamme        Paris staircase B   th floor  door on left Metro  Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again   All problems resolved        It was preposterous  And yet  it was tempting  What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed  After all  everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it   Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris s eighteenth arrondissement  an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa  It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way  cursing because he had not brought his umbrella  The door to number   b was swinging in the wind  its dark paint peeling badly  He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth floor door on which a brass plaque read   Professor Dhiakobli Sp cialiste des travaux occultes Please ring   He stood there  breathing heavily from the stairs  and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared    Please enter  my dear sir   said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy   I am Dhiakobli  And I have the honour to meet           As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined  Professor Dhiakobli was black  He had a short yet commanding figure  and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit  A large  silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket    For the moment   said Inspector Dutruelle   my name is hardly important  I ve only come in response to your advertisement     Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help  A minor indiscretion  Please be seated  sir  and let us talk about the matter    Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large  well upholstered chair to which he had been directed  Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk  on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging  its wide  moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer    Ah  I see that Zeus approves of you   said the Professor  stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers  his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle   Poor Zeus  mon petit papillon  he is devoted to me  but he must remain here whenever I leave France  And you are fortunate  monsieur  It is only now that I return from C te d Ivoire  It is my country you know  I return there for a few months each summer  Paris in summer is so disagreeable  don t you agree    Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success  The frames of his glasses  the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left  the gem studded rings on his fingers   all were of gold  From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man  Around him the large room was like a shrine  Heavy curtains excluded the daylight  the only illumination was a small brass desklamp  and the dark  red walls were festooned with spears  costumes  photographs and other African memorabilia  There was a sweet smell in the air  and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator  You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris    As I say   began Inspector Dutruelle  ignoring the Professor s question   I saw your card and I wondered just how you work     And may one enquire as to monsieur s little difficulty    Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could    Well     he coughed again    first of all  I wondered what sort of things you can help people with    The Professor s eyebrows rose    Anything   he said slowly  his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin   My dear sir  anything at all     And then  I wondered  how do you operate  That s to say  what exactly do you do       and how do you charge     Ah monsieur  let us not talk of money  First I must learn just how I can help you  And for that a consultation is in order    Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat    And what would a consultation involve  What does it       cost    Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably    Mon cher monsieur  I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money  I too recoil at the mere thought of it  It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune  And if some donate a small token of their gratitude  who am I to refuse their offering  They pay according to their means  to assist those who have little to offer  But for a preliminary consultation  monsieur  a nominal sum  as a mark of good faith  is usually in order  For a gentleman of your obvious standing  a trifle  a mere two hundred francs  And let me assure you  monsieur  of my absolute discretion  Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls   He paused  Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin   They have the sanctity of the confessional     I m glad to hear it   said the Inspector    But monsieur still has the advantage of me        continued Professor Dhiakobli   Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking  He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier  a Parisien wine merchant  and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul  He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients  of their instant and passionate love for one another  of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him  and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave  Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits  end and now even his business was suffering  He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret  The Professor listened intently  asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments  Finally Inspector Dutruelle said   Well  Professor Dhiakobli  I think that s all I can tell you  I don t think I can tell you any more  From what I have told you  do you believe you can help me    For a long time there was silence  The Professor appeared to be in another world  He stared at Inspector Dutruelle  but seemed to be looking through him    My dear Monsieur Mazodier   he said at last  very slowly  almost mechanically   the story you have told me is most poignant  Each of us has a hidden corner in his life  a jardin secret  Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours  Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women  At the mercy of their complex physical structure  is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures  I help them find their lost ones  their partners of many years  to recreate again the rapport of their youth  You will understand that it is not easy  But this is my work  My domain     So you can t help me   said Inspector Dutruelle  adding despondently   Perhaps what I really need is a head shrink    The Professor gave a start  Again  for a long time he did not answer  Then his teeth flashed in the dimness     coutez monsieur  this is my work  my domain   he repeated   Certainly I can help you  But you must understand that it will not be easy  It calls for a special ceremony  In the first place  you are married  and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women  In the second  we are both men of the world  monsieur  and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages  And finally  it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic  You know  the magic of Madagascar is very strong  No  monsieur  it will not be easy  Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone  Sometimes        He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye  his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant   Sometimes   he said   we must make sacrifices     What sort of sacrifices   asked Inspector Dutruelle dully    Oh  my dear sir  you must leave that to me  But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs   His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath   You must not concern yourself with technicalities  monsieur  Your mind must be fixed on the future  on the life you have dreamed of  You must envisage your wife   happy in the arms of another  You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for       secure in your arms       sharing your life       your days       your nights  The perfect solution to all your problems  Is it not worth a considerable sum     It certainly would be worth a lot        Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor s words came to life in his mind    Shall we say thirty thousand francs     I m sorry   muttered the Inspector    Let s say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards   the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken   Do you see  monsieur  how confident I am of success    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was confused  He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt  or to propose quite so generous a token  But it did not seem to matter  After all  what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately  And  in any case  at worst it was only fifteen thousand   The Professor s eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle    Of course  monsieur  I have faith in your gratitude  I know that you will not forget  in your delight  that what I have done  I can undo  And now  monsieur  you must not allow me to detain you further  We have much work to do  In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy  And with some little articles of clothing  something close to their thoughts  say a scarf or a hat  You can arrange this    Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly    Excellent  monsieur  I must know them in every detail   if I am to have a spiritual t te   t te with each of them  So  in fifteen days  you will return for the ceremony  It will take place beyond those curtains  in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits  Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there  but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day  It must be at dawn  and you must come without fail   the ceremony cannot be deferred  Can you manage six in the morning  shall we say Monday the sixteenth    Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December  At four o clock in the morning he got out of bed  Though his wife stirred she did not wake  He showered and dressed  His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen  boiling water for his coffee  He drank two cups  strong and black  but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam  He lit a Gauloise and paced the room  Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing  finishing his cigarette  Below him the courtyard was dark and silent  and above him the sky was black  But away in the east  through the open end of the court  a violet hue was creeping over Paris  He glanced at his watch  It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car  It would seem strange  leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver  He wondered what the concierge would make of it all   she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor  He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut   Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything  He looked into the bedroom  Gently  he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept  her arms clasped about her knees  He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek  Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him  switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen  and opened the front door  As he did so the telephone rang  It startled him and he cursed aloud  He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake    Inspector Dutruelle   said the voice at the other end    Yes  what is it     Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning  Monsieur l Inspecteur  It s the Pr fecture     Never mind the time   said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey   I m off duty today     Well  that s the point  Inspector  The Pr fet s ordered us to call you specially  He appreciates you re not on duty  but he wants you anyway     It s quite impossible     I m afraid he insists  sir     Why     He insists you come on duty immediately  sir  We re sending a car round for you     Yes  yes  I understand  but why     It s the Metro again  sir     The Metro     Yes  sir  They ve found another corpse on the line  decapitated again    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was cursing to himself  He was cursing the Pr fet  the police  this homicidal maniac  his wife  Why today  Why ever today    Sir  Hello sir  The car ll be with you in five minutes     Yes  all right  I ll be ready in five minutes    The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf  Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine  His dreams  it seemed  were evaporating just as surely    You d better brief me on this as quick as you can   he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car   Where was the body found     Barbes Rochechouart  sir    A cold shiver passed through the Inspector    I presume it s the same as the others   he asked    Well  in as much as there s nothing to go on  it s the same  sir  Otherwise it couldn t be more different  For a start  we ve just heard they ve found two of them now  And this time they re women  One white  in her forties  and one black  A young black girl   still in her teens  by the look of things    But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening  He was staring blankly through the glass to his right  and as they turned at Place du Ch telet the empty streets were no more than a cold  grey blur to him  The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de S bastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart  It was the route he should have been taking in his own car   Outside the station  now closed to passengers  people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up  Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car  He hesitated  He glanced towards Rue Beldamme  just a stone s throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart  where the Professor would be waiting for him  He shrugged and went down the station steps   Underground  on the number four line  there was an air of gloom  Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train drivers through that morning  Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one  It was the body of a middle aged woman  quite unexceptional  coarse and wiry  like his wife    She s forty seven  Monsieur l Inspecteur   said somebody beside him   French  Name of Madame Catherine Dubur  Not like the other one     The other one   said the Inspector blankly    I told you in the car  sir   said the Detective Sergeant at his ear   there s two of them     You d better show me    They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track  A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body  which lay on its back  Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff  black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines  Suddenly he shuddered in alarm  Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona    Identity   he asked  He tried to control his voice    We don t know  sir   this is all we found   said a policeman  handing him a tattered greetings card  Inside  in large  green handwriting  were the words   Happy Nineteenth Birthday  from Everyone in Antananarivo     D you think she s Malagasy  sir   asked the policeman  The Inspector shrugged his shoulders  then held out an open hand    Your torch  please   he said   He played its beam over the body  up and down the long  slender legs  across the clothes  At least he did not recognise the clothes  Yet the body s size  its build  its colour  everything pointed to Vololona  He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him  He stood up in relief  That was certainly not Vololona  Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her   and the other of Agnes  for that matter  Even the ages were the same   He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse  He could not understand  Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere  And what of Agnes  How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that  How could he explain it  when you came to think of it  When you came to think of it  he had explained very little  He had been happy enough to take the money  and free enough with his words   all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual t te   t tes        Inspector Dutruelle gasped    The devil   he muttered to himself  Suddenly he understood everything    The what  sir   said somebody beside him    Never mind   he answered quietly  putting his hand to his breast pocket  His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions  He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise  Through its curling blue smoke  back lit by the lights of the train  the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance  while beside him men s voices were thrumming in his ear  Why was there no time to think  to extricate himself from this nightmare  He cursed himself  How could he have been so stupid  He cursed his wife and Vololona  And Professor Dhiakobli  What madness had driven him to this  Then he cursed himself again  and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side    What time is it     Six fifteen  sir    For a moment  he hesitated  Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body     coute Guy  when he s got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up   he said   Now get me the Pr fet    The Pr fet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep  and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation    Are you insane  man  You re in the middle of an investigation     The investigation is over  Monsieur le Pr fet     So  you have the killer at last     In fifteen minutes  monsieur  in fifteen minutes     Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty

his first pieces theMaple Leaf Rag  became ragtime s first and most influential hit and has been recognized as the archetypal rag[] Joplin was born into a musical family of laborers in Northeast Texas  and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers most notablyJulius Weiss  Joplin grew up in Texarkana  where he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar During the late s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad and travelled around theAmerican South  as an itinerant musician He went to Chicago for theWorld s Fair  of  which played a major part in making

compose and publish music and regularly performed in the St Louis community By the time he had moved to St Louis he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearly as a result of having contractedsyphilis  The score to his first opera A Guest of Honor  was confiscated in  with his belongings owing to his nonpayment of bills and is considered

in late  or early  Although for many years his birth date was accepted as November   research has revealed that this is almost certainly inaccurate the most likely approximate date being the second half of []  He was the second of six children the others being Monroe Robert William Myrtle and Ossie[]  born to Giles Joplin an exslave from North Carolina  and Florence Givens a freeborn AfricanAmerican woman fromKentucky [] [] []  The Joplins subsequently moved to Texarkana where Giles worked as a laborer for the railroad while Florence was a cleaner Joplin s father had played theviolin  for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo []  Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned[] At some point in the early s Giles Joplin left the family for another woman leaving Florence to provide for her children through domestic work Biographer Susan Curtis speculated that his mother s support of Joplin s musical education was an important causal factor in this separation His father argued that it took the boy away from practical employment that would supplement the family income[] According to a family friend the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing the piano after school While a few local teachers aided him he received most of his music education fromJulius Weiss  a GermanJewish  music professor who had immigrated to the United States from Germany[]  Weiss had studied music at university in Germany and was listed in town records as aProfessor of music Impressed by Joplin s talent and realizing his family s dire straits Weiss taught him free of charge He tutored the yearold Joplin until he was  during which time Weiss introduced him tofolk  and classical music including opera Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an art as well as an entertainment[]  and helped his mother acquire a used piano According to his wife Lottie Joplin never forgot Weiss and in his later years when he achieved fame as a composer sent his former teacher gifts of money when he was old and ill until Weiss died[]  At the age of  Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana playing piano In addition he taught guitar and mandolin[] Life in the Southern states and Chicago[edit ]In the late s having performed at various local events as a teenager Joplin chose to give up work as a laborer with the railroad and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician[]  Little is known about his movements at this time although he is recorded in Texarkana in July  as a member of theTexarkana Minstrels in a performance that happened to be raising money for a monument toJefferson Davis  President of the Southern Confederacy[]  He soon discovered however that there were few opportunities for black pianists Churches andbrothels  were among the few options for steady work Joplin played preragtime  jigpiano  in variousredlight districts  throughout the midSouth and some claim he was in Sedalia and St Louis during this time[] [] In  Joplin was in Chicago for the World s Fair  While in Chicago he formed his first band playingcornet  and began arranging music for the group to perform Although the World s Fair minimized the involvement of AfricanAmericans black performers still came to the saloons cafs and brothels that lined the fair The exposition was attended by  million Americans and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life including ragtime Although specific information is sparse numerous sources have credited the Chicago World Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime[]  Joplin found that his music as well as that of other black performers was popular with visitors[]  By  ragtime had become a national craze in American cities and was described by theSt Louis Dispatch as a veritable call of the wild which mightily stirred the pulses of city bred people[] Life in Missouri[edit ]A  recording of the Maple Leaf Rag by the United States Marine Band This is the first surviving recording of theMaple Leaf Rag  []  []

At first Joplin stayed with the family ofArthur Marshall  at the time a year old boy but later one of Joplin s students and a ragtime composer in his own right[]  There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until  as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician     Front cover of the third edition of the Maple Leaf Rag sheet music There is little precise evidence known about Joplin s activities at this time although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia theBlack  club and the Maple Leaf Club He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own sixpiece dance orchestra A tour with his own singing group the Texas Medley Quartet gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions and it is known that he went toSyracuse New York  and Texas Two businessmen from New York published Joplin s first two works the songsPlease Say You Will and A Picture of her Face in []  Joplin s visit toTemple Texas  enabled him to have three pieces published there in  including theGreat Crush Collision March  which commemorated aplanned train crash  on the MissouriKansasTexas Railroad  on September  that he may have witnessed The March was described by one of Joplin s biographers as a special early essay in ragtime[]  While in Sedalia he was teaching piano to students who included future ragtime composersArthur Marshall  Brun Campbell  and Scott Hayden []  In turn Joplin enrolled at theGeorge R Smith College  where he apparently studied advanced harmony and composition The College records were destroyed in a fire in []  and biographer Edward A Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for AfricanAmericans would be able to provide such a course[] [] [] In  Joplin married Belle the sisterinlaw of collaborator Scott Hayden  Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the Maple Leaf Rag was published Joplin was not far behind His first published ragOriginal Rags  had been completed in  the same year as the first ragtime work in print theMississippi Rag by William Krell  The Maple Leaf Rag was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in  Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around []  The exact circumstances that led to the Maple Leaf Rag s publication are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers Joplin signed a contract on August   withJohn Stillwell Stark  a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a  royalty on all sales of the rag with a minimum sales price of  cents[]  With the inscription To the Maple Leaf Club prominently visible along the top of at least some editions it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club although there is no direct evidence to prove the link and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time[]     Scott Joplin House  in St Louis Missouri  There have been many claims about the sales of theMaple Leaf Rag for example that Joplin was the first musician to sell  million copies of a piece of instrumental music[]  Joplin s first biographerRudi Blesh  wrote that during its first six months the piece sold  copies and became the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America[]  However research by Joplin s later biographer Edward A Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case the initial printrun of  took one year to sell and under the terms of Joplin s contract with a  royalty would have given Joplin an income of  or approximately at current prices Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses In  estimated sales would have given him an income of  annually approximately in current prices[] The Maple Leaf Rag did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers especially in the development of classic ragtime[]  After the publication of theMaple Leaf Rag Joplin was soon being described as King of rag time writers not least by himself[]  on the covers of his own work such asThe Easy Winners  and Elite Syncopations After the Joplins moved to St Louis  in early  they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth Joplin s relationship with his wife was difficult as she had no interest in music They eventually separated and then divorced[]  About this time Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags[]  It was in St Louis that Joplin produced some of his bestknown works includingThe Entertainer  March Majestic and the short theatrical work The Ragtime Dance In June  Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock Arkansas  the young woman to whom he had dedicatedThe Chrysanthemum She died on September   of complications resulting from a cold ten weeks after their wedding[]  Joplin s first work copyrighted after Freddie s death Bethena  was described by one biographer as an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtimewaltzes [] During this time Joplin created an opera company of  people and produced his first operaA Guest of Honor  for a national tour It is not certain how many productions were staged or even if this was an allblack show or a racially mixed production During the tour either inSpringfield Illinois  orPittsburg Kansas  someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts Joplin could not meet the company s payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house It is believed that the score forA Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of nonpayment of the company s boarding house bill[] Later years[edit ]     Front cover of the Wall Street Rag  sheet music In  Joplin moved to New York City which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera After his move to New York Joplin met Lottie Stokes whom he married in []  In  unable to find a publisher Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishingTreemonisha  himself in pianovocal format In  as a lastditch effort to see it performed he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall inHarlem  Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment it was a miserable failure to a public not ready for crude black musical formsso different from the European grand opera of that time[]  The audience including potential backers was indifferent and walked out[]  Scott writes that after a disastrous single performance  Joplin suffered a breakdown He was bankrupt discouraged and worn out He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles Treemonisha went unnoticed and unreviewed largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music a field closed to African Americans[]  In fact it was not until the s that the opera received a full theatrical stagingIn  Joplin and Lottie selfpublished his Magnetic Rag  as the Scott Joplin Music Company which he had formed the previous December[]  Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due tosyphilis  and was consciously racing against time In her sleeve notes on the Deutsche Grammophon  release of Treemonisha  she notes that he plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera day and night with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts page by page as each page of the full score was completed[] Death[edit ]By  Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilis  and a resulting descent into insanity[] []  In January  he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital  a mental institution[]  He died there on April  of syphilitic dementia at the age of [] []  and was buried in a pauper s grave that remained unmarked for  years His grave at Saint Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in []

music and Joplin s natural ability has been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended AfricanAmerican musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the sragtime [] When Joplin was learning the piano serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs cranked out by the tunesmiths ofTin Pan Alley []  As a composer Joplin refined ragtime elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the wandering honkytonk pianists playing mere dance music of popular imagination[]  This new art form the classic rag  combined AfroAmerican folk music ssyncopation  and thcentury European romanticism  with its harmonic schemes and its marchlike tempos[] []  In the words of one critic Ragtime was basically an AfroAmerican version of the polka or its analog theSousa style march[]  With this as a foundation Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them without improvisation[]  Joplin wrote his rags as classical music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its cheap bordello origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as  more tuneful contrapuntal infectious and harmonically colorful than any others of his era[] Some speculate that Joplin s achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacherJulius Weiss  who may have brought a polka  rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the year old Joplin[]  As Curtis put it The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware[] Joplin s first and most significant hit the Maple Leaf Rag was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least  years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns melody lines and harmony[]  though with the exception of Joseph Lamb  they generally failed to enlarge upon it[] Treemonisha[edit ]    Treemonisha    Main article Treemonisha  The opera s setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin s childhood town Texarkana in September  The plot centers on an year old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps  nest when her friend Remus rescues her The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader[] [] [] Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias ensembles and choruses In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident inTreemonisha are common in the operatic tradition and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composerRichard Wagner  of which Joplin was aware A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from inDie Walkre  and the retelling of the heroine s origins echos aspects of the operaSiegfried  In addition AfricanAmerican folk tales also influence the storythe wasp nest incident is similar to the story ofBr er Rabbit  and the briar patch[] Treemonisha is not a ragtime operabecause Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly using them to convey racial character and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the th century The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late th century recreated by a skilled and sensitive participant[] Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin s own life He notes that Lottie Joplin the composer s third wife saw a connection between the character Treemonisha s wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer In addition it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie Joplin s second wife because the date of the opera s setting was likely to have been the month of her birth[] At the time of the opera s publication in  the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as an entirely new form of operatic art[]  Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history with its heroine a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement[]  Curtis s conclusion is similar In the end Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy learning hard work and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race[]  Berlin describes it as a fine opera certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States but later states that Joplin s own libretto showed the composer was not a competent dramatist with the book not up to the quality of the music[] Performance skills[edit ]Pleasant Moments Ragtime Waltz played by Scott Joplin April   Sorry your browser either has JavaScript disabled or

Sedalia  newspaper in  and fellow ragtime composersArthur Marshall  and Joe Jordan  both said that he played the instrument well[]  However the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper rather than at the pianoArtie Matthews  recalled the delight the St Louis players took in outplaying Joplin[] While Joplin never made an audio recording his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls  for use in mechanical player pianos  All seven were made in  Of these the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing[]  probably by William Axtmann the staff arranger at Connorized[]  Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St Louis he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearlyall symptoms of thesyphilis  that took his life in []  Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of Maple Leaf Rag on the UniRecord label from June  as shocking disorganized and completely distressing to hear[]  While there is disagreement among pianoroll experts about the accuracy of the reproduction of a player s performance[] [] [] []  Berlin notes that the Maple Leaf Rag roll was painfully bad and likely to be the truest record of Joplin s playing at the time The roll however does not reflect his abilities earlier in life[] Legacy[edit ]     Nonpareil  Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes changing American musical taste Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties  Joplin s ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America[] Joshua Rifkin  a leading Joplin recording artist wrote A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work and even at his most highspirited he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity  He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him[]  Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety  Joplin did for the rag whatChopin  did for themazurka  His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated thebolero  and the tango []  Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin s music had helped to revolutionise American music and culture by removing Victorian restraint[] Composer and actor Max Morath  found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin s work did not enjoy the popularity of theMaple Leaf Rag because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his lifetime[]  Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin opined thatMaple Leaf Rag would make him  King of Ragtime Composers  but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime  When I m dead twentyfive years people are going to recognize me  he told a friend Just over thirty years later he was recognized and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin[] Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music And as a pioneer composer and performer he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of both races After his death jazz historian Floyd Levin noted Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers the man who gave America a genuine native music[] Revival[edit ]After his death in  Joplin s music and ragtime in general waned in popularity as new forms of musical styles such asjazz  and novelty piano  emerged Even so jazz bands and recording artists such asTommy Dorsey  in Jelly Roll Morton  in  and J Russell Robinson  in  released recordings of Joplin compositionsMaple Leaf Rag was the Joplin piece found most often on rpm  records[] In the s a smallscale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars such as Trebor TichenorWilliam Bolcom  William Albright  and Rudi Blesh  Audiophile Records  released a two record setThe Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin The Greatest of Ragtime Composers performed by Knocky Parker  in [] In  Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin  a young musicologist in the body of Joplin s work Together they hosted an occasional ragtimeandearlyjazz evening onWBAI  radio[]  In November  Rifkin released a recording calledScott Joplin Piano Rags []  on the classical  label Nonesuch  It sold  copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch s first millionselling record[]  The Billboard BestSelling Classical LPs chart for September   has the record at number  with the followup Volume  at number  and a combined set of both volumes at number  Separately both volumes had been on the chart for  weeks In the top  spots on that chart  of the entries were recordings of Joplin s work three of which were Rifkin s[]  Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section The album was nominated in  for twoGrammy Award  categories Best Album Notes  and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance without orchestra  Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin but at the ceremony on March   Rifkin did not win in any category[]  He did a tour in  which included appearances on BBC  Television and a sellout concert at London sRoyal Festival Hall []  In Alan Rich  in the New York Magazine  wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin s music on diskNonesuch Records  created almost alone the Scott Joplin revival[] In January  Harold C Schonberg  music critic at the New York Times  having just heard the Rifkin album wrote a featured Sunday edition article entitled Scholars Get Busy on Scott Joplin[]  Schonberg s call to action has been described as the catalyst for classical music scholars the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life to conclude that Joplin was a genius[]  Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library  published a

RecordsMore Scott Joplin Rags in  and The Road From Rags To Jazz in In  film producer George Roy Hill  contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately asking each man to write the score for a film project he was working onThe Sting  Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments Instead Hill foundMarvin Hamlisch  available and brought him into the project as composer[]  Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin s music for theThe Sting for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation  on April  []  His version of The Entertainer reached number  on theBillboard Hot   and the American Top   music chart on May  [] []  prompting The New York Times  to write The whole nation has begun to take notice[]  Thanks to the film and its score Joplin s work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world becoming in the words of music magazineRecord World  the classical phenomenon of the decade[]  Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin s style and his band adaptations from Schuller s style[]  Schuller said Hamlisch got the Oscar for music he didn t write since it is by Joplin and arrangements he didn t write and  editions  he didn t make A lot of people were upset by that but that s show biz[] On October   excerpts from Treemonisha were presented in concert form atLincoln Center  with musical performances by Bolcom Rifkin and Mary Lou Williams  supporting a group of singers[]  Finally on January   TJ Anderson s orchestration ofTreemonisha was staged for two consecutive

2014-07-05 17:32:28 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex   How to Avoid Burnout Are You Falling for This Myth   You want to earn a spot in your niche with your incredible range of insights and experience  So you work diligently by squeezing content creation in between meetings  calls  emails  professional projects  home projects  family time  and much more   You think you’re on a great track and you’ll never burn out as long as you keep up your momentum   Eventually  you start to stay a little later working on projects and even work on weekends  You begin worrying about whether it’s working or if you should hedge your bets with this whole writing thing    Never mind   you say  You still hold on to the idea that you will never burn out   giving up and in to burnout is for idle  non dedicated people who don’t share your vision or passion  Short of an uncontrollable disaster  all you have to do is keep up this momentum and your hard work will pay off in the end   right  Wrong   A Seemingly Never Ending Balancing Act  That phrase you keep repeating   I’ll never burn out   is a myth  This busywork that’s masquerading as  dedication  is the road to burnout  How do you know   Do any of the following statements apply to you        Bad  days are more frequent than good      Most of your time is spent on tasks that seem impossible or are monotonous      You’re exhausted   if not all of the time  most of the time      You don’t feel appreciated or what you do makes a difference      You feel unmotivated   you can’t see value in caring about your work or even home life      You’re overwhelmed by venturing into a new territory      You feel like you’re going nowhere   If none of these apply to you  feel free to skip to the end and share your secrets to burnout prevention  If any of these apply to you  even in the slightest increment  then you’re showing signs of burnout  In turn  this could be negatively affecting your ability to accomplish your goals and have serious physical repercussions  The time is now to deal with it because you have a lot to lose if burnout gets the best of you   It’s Time for a Time Out  To address and prevent burnout  you need to stop and take a step back  Consider not only how you got there  but how you will bail yourself out to replenish your energy to accomplish your greater goals  Use these tips       Take a break        I can’t slow down   I have all of these things to do   Once you’ve reached burnout status  it’s hard to break habits that either serve little value or perpetuate the burnout balancing act  Slow down  This isn’t a request  Do it  Where you can  cut back on commitments that show little value and ask for help or delegate tasks  such as asking someone to proofread your content for you or even consider hiring a ghostwriter or transcriber  You cannot accomplish everything at once and deliver quality  Give yourself some time to recharge both your mind and body       Reevaluate your goals and priorities        I don’t even know where to begin    Here’s an exercise to get you started       Break down your obligations  duties  and tasks into two columns  In the first column  write all of those things people are depending on you to accomplish or what can only be done by you  In the second column  write down those things you do that could be done by someone else or reasonably eliminated altogether       Think of each item in your second column to be your  burnout relief  to do list by delegating these tasks or jettisoning them from your routine if they lack value       Next  write down your goals   personal  home  writing  and work goals that will create value in your life and work  Compare your goals to your first column  Is there anything that you can move over to the second column  Allow your goals to be the ruler that helps you measure your tasks and commitments   if it doesn’t measure up  delegate or eliminate it       For all commitments and tasks that remain in the first column  create a plan       Have a plan and rekindle your motivation        A goal is just a wish without a plan   Whatever type of plan you choose to implement   whether it targets your personal  professional  or writing goals   make sure it contains at least these three elements          It targets a specific goal          It’s broken into actionable steps          It’s rewarding   What I Do to Prevent Burnout  I’m S M A R T    that is  I plan S M A R T  goals by asking myself the following questions       Specific  What do I want to accomplish and what are its requirements or constraints      Measurable  What are the indicators I use to measure its success or achievement      Achievable  What are the steps I will take to accomplish this goal      Relevant  Is it worthwhile      Timely  What milestones should I meet or when will it be finally accomplished   Another strategy I’m a huge fan of is the to do list   daily lists  project lists  writing lists  shopping lists  activity lists  and honey do lists  a list for my husband      anything can chunked into a list  Call me peculiar  but I find an indescribable satisfaction in checking off each item as I finish it  which creates a powerful momentum that propels me through each task  For tasks I didn’t plan for and do  I’ll add it to my list  after the fact  to cross it off   Don’t wait  When you’re burned out  anything and everything can be a bear to handle  Change your course  Own your plan  Wear it out like a pair of running shoes until you can see through the soles because of all of the mileage you got out of it  Use these tips to alleviate stress  prevent burnout  and add more valuable contributions to your family  your niche  and your own peace of mind   What do you do to avoid burnout  Let us know   we’d love to hear from you

author Alison K Klika ms Cleveland Clinic  Euclid Ave A Cleveland OH  emailklikaaatccforg   Next Section  AbstractBackground Longterm acute care hospitals are an option for patients in intensive care units who require prolonged care after an acute illness Predicting use of these facilities may help hospitals improve resource management expenditures and quality of care delivered in intensive careObjective To develop a predictive tool for early identification of intensive care patients with increased probability of transfer to such a hospitalMethods Data on  adults admitted to intensive care at a tertiary care hospital between January  and June  were retrospectively reviewed The prediction model was developed by using multiple ordinal logistic regression The model was internally validated via the bootstrapping technique and externally validated with a control cohort of  intensive care patientsResults Among the study group  patients  were discharged to longterm acute care hospitals and   to home or other care facilities   died in the intensive care unit The final prediction algorithm showed good accuracy biascorrected concordance index   CI  excellent calibration and external validation concordance index   CI  Hypoalbuminemia was the greatest potential driver of increased likelihood of discharge to a longterm acute care hospital Other important predictors were intensive care unit category older age extended hospital stay before admission to intensive care severe pressure ulcers admission source and dependency on mechanical ventilationConclusions This new predictive tool can help estimate on the first day of admission to intensive care the likelihood of a patients discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalThe economic impact of and demand for critical care services in the United States are intensifying From  to  annual critical care expenditures increased from  billion to  billion  In  critical care services accounted for approximately  of national health care expenditures and  of the US gross domestic product  Part of the increased costs and demand for intensive care unit ICU services are due to a subgroup of critically ill patients who survive acute illness and require prolonged lifesupport care   These patients also termed chronically critically ill represent a problem of growing importance Chronically critically ill patients account for only  to  of all ICU admissions but for approximately  of total ICU expenditures   The increasing costs and demand for critical care services in the United States have resulted in greater emphasis on efficient ICU resource management and improvement in quality of care    Development of care practices for chronically critically ill patients is a considerable challenge not only for ICU clinicians but also for the health system as a whole  Changes in reimbursement and the continued increase in the number of chronically critically ill patients have increased pressures on acute care hospitals to reduce the length of stay and cost of care  Longterm acute care hospitals LTACHs are facilities that have recently emerged in response to the demand for prolonged care after an acute illness  These facilities offer multiple benefits to patients and acute care hospitals including reduction of underreimbursed costs more efficient ICU bed procurement and improvement of benchmarking measurements     As a result the utilization and number of LTACHs have been increasing at a high rate Our primary objective in this study was to develop a predictive algorithm for early identification of ICU patients with a high probability of discharge to an LTACH We hypothesized that sufficient accuracy could be achieved by using predictor variables that were available within the first  hours of ICU admission Formerly no such predictive instrument has existed Although experienced ICU clinicians may use various clinical characteristics and laboratory results to estimate the future need for LTACH transfer this clinical assessment can be influenced by multiple biases  A predictive tool permits the clinical care team to make decisions based on and supported by objective data rather than subjective intuition Individualized prediction of discharge to an LTACH may allow for strategic planning to improve ICU resource management and quality of care In addition early and objective identification of ICU patients with the greatest likelihood of LTACH transfer could facilitate LTACH referrals encourage preparation of patients and their families and decrease financial issues for the patients and the hospitalsIncreased costs for ICU services come in part from the chronically critically illPrevious Section  Next Section  MethodsSample SelectionThis retrospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center with  adult ICU beds Approval was granted by the appropriate institutional review board informed consent was not required Data for development of the model were obtained from the medical records of  patients  years or older who had been admitted to an ICU between January  and June VariablesA team of clinicians and research staff developed a list of  demographic ICU admission and medical variables that they thought had empirical or theoretical relevance to discharge to an LTACH seeTable  Demographic variables included age sex and body mass index ICU admission was summarized by  variables length of stay before ICU admission source of admission ICU category and type of ICU admission Length of stay before ICU admission was defined as the number of days the patient stayed in the hospital directly before being admitted to the ICU Source of admission was the site from which the patient was transferred to the ICU  the emergency department  the hospital unit or operating room or  a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or an other hospital ICU category was defined as the admitting ICU cardiovascular coronary heart failure medical neurosurgical surgical Type of ICU admission indicated whether or not the admission was planned or anticipated by the care team ie discussed in notes before the admission or treatment intervention The remaining  physiological and laboratory variables were measures of medical status during the first  hours of ICU admission The response variable discharge disposition was collapsed into  categories LTACH home or other care facilities ie nonLTACH and death in the ICU Other care facilities encompassed skilled nursing facilities as well as acute and chronic rehabilitation facilitiesView this table   In this window    In a new window  Table Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis of model development cohortStatistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version  SAS Institute Inc and R statistical software version  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Univariate analyses to compare the LTACH group with the nonLTACH and ICUdeath groups were performed by using the MannWhitney test Pearson  test or Fisher exact test as appropriate Differences were considered significant atP   With all  established variables see Table  a multiple ordinal logistic regression model was developed to predict the outcome of LTACH discharge A simultaneous approach ie all variables entered at a single step was implemented rather than a stepwise procedure for analysis as recommended by Harrell et al  Missing data in the development cohort were estimated by using themice multivariate imputation by chained equations function in R statistical software generating several imputations by using Gibbs sampling  The coefficients from the resulting multiple logistic regression model were used to construct a paperbased graphic calculation tool called a nomogram by using the design library of R statistical software Points for each predictor were determined by rescaling the regression coefficients to adapt to a userfriendly point scale Variable importance in the final model was ascertained from the relative potential contribution of points as deduced from the nomogram and the length of the axis Variables with longer axes have greater potential predictive effect in the modelInternal validation of the model with the original development data was determined by using the bootstrapping technique to correct for overfitting bias  During this process a random bootstrap sample of the original data was generated from the cohort and the model was applied to this sample to yield predicted results  This technique was repeated  times to obtain a biascorrected estimate of the models predictive accuracy Discrimination of the model was quantified by using the concordance index ie the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve The concordance index ranges from  random discrimination to  perfect discrimination and represents the ability of the model to accurately assign a higher probability to the patient discharged to LTACH for a randomly selected pair of patients with one discharged to LTACH and the other not Typically predictive tests are considered of clinical value when the concordance index is greater than    Calibration an additional measure of model performance illustrates how well the models predictions agree with the observed outcomes Calibration was assessed graphically by plotting predicted vs actual probabilities for discharge to LTACH A model with perfect predictions generates a calibration curve that lies on the  lineTwentyone variables that had empirical or theoretical relevance to longterm acute care were usedThe predictive tool was externally validated with an independent cohort of  ICU patients at the same institution admitted between January  and March  The sample size of the validation cohort was estimated to provide greater than  statistical power to conclude a concordance index of the validation data set assumed to be approximately  on the basis of the data for the development cohort is significantly greater than  Discrimination of the model on the external validation sample was quantified with the concordance index and calibration was assessed graphicallyUsing the nomogram Figure   to calculate the predicted probability of LTACH discharge requires the following steps  locate the patients category or value on the axis corresponding to the respective predictor variable  draw a vertical line upward to the points axis to determine how many points are assigned for that characteristic in the model  repeat this process for the remaining predictor variable axes determining the points for each predictor independently  sum the points achieved for all predictors  locate this summed point value on the total points axis and draw a vertical line down to the probability axis to calculate the

hypoalbuminemia ie serum level of albumin  gdL is potentially the most influential predictor of increased likelihood of discharge to an LTACH ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU particularly neurosurgical ICU older age ie  years extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission ie  days presence of stage  or higher pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early dependency on mechanical ventilation also contribute substantial points  points or higher to the model increasing the predicted probability of LTACH discharge Only extreme values of PaO serum levels of creatinine or total bilirubin or platelet count contribute any meaningful amounts to the predicted risk Sex and requirements for dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine during the first  hours of ICU admission have minor impacts on the prediction of discharge to an LTACH ie contributed a relatively small number of points to the nomogram total score

validation data setPrevious Section  Next Section  DiscussionWe used demographic ICU admission and ICU clinical data measured during the first  hours of ICU admission to construct and validate a predictive model for estimating future use of an LTACH The models discrimination and calibration in the development and validation cohorts indicate it makes it possible to accurately predict the likelihood of LTACH use among ICU patients The most potentially influential determinants of this outcome included hypoalbuminemia ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU older age extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission presence of severe pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early requirement for mechanical ventilation These findings confirm and extend those of previous investigations   which have shown that in addition to dependency on mechanical ventilation older age and greater severity of illness other considerations are important for assessing disposition of discharge from an ICUThe model shows a strong direct association between hypoalbuminemia and the likelihood of discharge to an LTACH This finding may be explained by the underlying nutritional status hepatic failure cirrhosis andor acute response to stress or sepsis among critically ill patients   Several studies   have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased mortality morbidity ICU length of stay and resource utilization in critically ill patients Scheinhorn et al  found that hypoalbuminemia was common among patients admitted to an LTACH and previous investigators   emphasized its importance in predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation and chronic critical illness ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU contribute substantial points to the models predicted risk for discharge to an LTACH This result most likely occurs because these noncardiovascular ICUs typically receive more unplanned critically ill ICU patients than does a cardiovascular ICU A majority of cardiovascular ICU admissions  in a cardiovascular ICU vs  in all other ICUs are planned temporary eg  hours ICU transfers immediately after surgery as a monitoring precaution before the patient is moved to a stepdown unit Finally the predictive value of deepwound pressure ulceration within the LTACH discharge model is supported by the results of other investigations    The frequency of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients is a result of multiple comorbid conditions inability to move impaired angiogenesis response and dependency on mechanical ventilation  Our results suggest that stage  or higher pressure ulcers early in the ICU admission are associated with a higher likelihood of discharge to an LTACHOur findings are especially relevant because of the current initiatives to improve care practices for patients who are chronically critically ill      Early identification of LTACH use may allow clinical care teams to make appropriate arrangements for patients care after discharge from the ICU improve the transition of care ensure bed availability and avoid potential delays in patients discharge As emphasized by Zimmerman et al  discharge planning started shortly after ICU admission allows for more efficient use of ICU resources Enhanced ICU bed utilization has a variety of clinical implications including potentially better outcomes and farreaching financial value Older age presence of severe pressure ulcers early mechanical ventilation are also predictors of discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalLTACHs may improve outcomes for chronically critically ill patients through specialized care These hospitals often embrace a multidisciplinary and rehabilitationbased approach to treatment providing a setting with experienced health professionals and ample clinical resources for the care of patients who are chronically critically ill     Votto et al  reported that the clinical outcomes including inhospital mortality and discharges to home were significantly better for patients transferred to an LTACH than for similar patients who remained in acute care hospitals Furthermore patients treated at an LTACH are less likely to be readmitted to an acute care hospital than are those treated in alternative care settings after discharge from an ICU In addition to potential clinical benefits financial advantages may exist that support the use of LTACHs for chronically critically ill patients Cost reduction by LTACHs has been achieved by focusing on efficient staff operation and incorporation of care protocols as well as service and resource standardization  Votto et al  compared costs between LTACHeligible patients transferred and not transferred to an LTACH and concluded that the mean total cost per patient at an LTACH   was less than that at an acute care hospital  In a study  of critically ill patients with tracheostomies total Medicare expenses related to the admission ie acute and postacute care were less for patients in an LTACH than for patients in other settings Conversely results of a study  examining Medicare claims for a variety of patient types indicated that although patients transferred to an LTACH had decreased costs in the acute setting their total cost of care was higher than that of patients discharged to other postacute care facilities eg skilled nursing facility rehabilitation facility Although evidence     indicates that LTACH utilization results in considerable cost savings for acute care hospitals the economic impact of LTACH facilities on US health care expenditures is still undeterminedUnfortunately evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of LTACH utilization to treat patients with longterm illnesses The current interpretation is primarily based on retrospective studies which may introduce multiple biases The economic impact of LTACH utilization and whether these facilities actually help improve the longterm outcomes of chronically critically ill patients must be properly evaluated If compelling evidence supports therapeutic benefits of LTACH usage implementation of interventions designed to discharge chronically critically ill patients to an LTACH would be a safe approach to providing critical care services in a costeffective wayOur study has some notable limitations Our development and validation cohorts were patients admitted to a single tertiary care institution a situation that may limit the applicability of the results In addition the retrospective design may have introduced ascertainment bias The study design also restricted our analysis to data contained within the electronic health records preventing us from including other factors known to influence LTACH utilization such as payer source patient and clinician preference LTACH discharge criteria bed availability and geographic limitations  Previous Section  Next Section  ConclusionsThis study was our first effort at developing a clinical instrument to predict early in a patients ICU admission the probability of that patients discharge to an LTACH We think that this predictive tool offers a valuable perspective for patients patients family members clinicians and hospitals When complemented by the clinicians judgment as well as feedback from patients and their family members this risk calculator has the potential to improve the quality of care delivered to chronically critically ill patients while enhancing ICU resource managementPrevious Section  Next

his first pieces theMaple Leaf Rag  became ragtime s first and most influential hit and has been recognized as the archetypal rag[] Joplin was born into a musical family of laborers in Northeast Texas  and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers most notablyJulius Weiss  Joplin grew up in Texarkana  where he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar During the late s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad and travelled around theAmerican South  as an itinerant musician He went to Chicago for theWorld s Fair  of  which played a major part in making

also brought the composer a steady income for life though Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problemsJoplin moved to St Louis  in  where he continued to compose and publish music and regularly performed in the St Louis community By the time he had moved to St Louis he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearly as a result of having contractedsyphilis  The score to his first opera A Guest of Honor  was confiscated in  with his belongings owing to his nonpayment of bills and is considered

in late  or early  Although for many years his birth date was accepted as November   research has revealed that this is almost certainly inaccurate the most likely approximate date being the second half of []  He was the second of six children the others being Monroe Robert William Myrtle and Ossie[]  born to Giles Joplin an exslave from North Carolina  and Florence Givens a freeborn AfricanAmerican woman fromKentucky [] [] []  The Joplins subsequently moved to Texarkana where Giles worked as a laborer for the railroad while Florence was a cleaner Joplin s father had played theviolin  for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo []  Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned[] At some point in the early s Giles Joplin left the family for another woman leaving Florence to provide for her children through domestic work Biographer Susan Curtis speculated that his mother s support of Joplin s musical education was an important causal factor in this separation His father argued that it took the boy away from practical employment that would supplement the family income[] According to a family friend the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing the piano after school While a few local teachers aided him he received most of his music education fromJulius Weiss  a GermanJewish  music professor who had immigrated to the United States from Germany[]  Weiss had studied music at university in Germany and was listed in town records as aProfessor of music Impressed by Joplin s talent and realizing his family s dire straits Weiss taught him free of charge He tutored the yearold Joplin until he was  during which time Weiss introduced him tofolk  and classical music including opera Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an art as well as an entertainment[]  and helped his mother acquire a used piano According to his wife Lottie Joplin never forgot Weiss and in his later years when he achieved fame as a composer sent his former teacher gifts of money when he was old and ill until Weiss died[]  At the age of  Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana playing piano In addition he taught guitar and mandolin[] Life in the Southern states and Chicago[edit ]In the late s having performed at various local events as a teenager Joplin chose to give up work as a laborer with the railroad and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician[]  Little is known about his movements at this time although he is recorded in Texarkana in July  as a member of theTexarkana Minstrels in a performance that happened to be raising money for a monument toJefferson Davis  President of the Southern Confederacy[]  He soon discovered however that there were few opportunities for black pianists Churches andbrothels  were among the few options for steady work Joplin played preragtime  jigpiano  in variousredlight districts  throughout the midSouth and some claim he was in Sedalia and St Louis during this time[] [] In  Joplin was in Chicago for the World s Fair  While in Chicago he formed his first band playingcornet  and began arranging music for the group to perform Although the World s Fair minimized the involvement of AfricanAmericans black performers still came to the saloons cafs and brothels that lined the fair The exposition was attended by  million Americans and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life including ragtime Although specific information is sparse numerous sources have credited the Chicago World Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime[]  Joplin found that his music as well as that of other black performers was popular with visitors[]  By  ragtime had become a national craze in American cities and was described by theSt Louis Dispatch as a veritable call of the wild which mightily stirred the pulses of city bred people[] Life in Missouri[edit ]A  recording of the Maple Leaf Rag by the United States Marine Band This is the first surviving recording of theMaple Leaf Rag  []  []

At first Joplin stayed with the family ofArthur Marshall  at the time a year old boy but later one of Joplin s students and a ragtime composer in his own right[]  There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until  as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician     Front cover of the third edition of the Maple Leaf Rag sheet music There is little precise evidence known about Joplin s activities at this time although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia theBlack  club and the Maple Leaf Club He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own sixpiece dance orchestra A tour with his own singing group the Texas Medley Quartet gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions and it is known that he went toSyracuse New York  and Texas Two businessmen from New York published Joplin s first two works the songsPlease Say You Will and A Picture of her Face in []  Joplin s visit toTemple Texas  enabled him to have three pieces published there in  including theGreat Crush Collision March  which commemorated aplanned train crash  on the MissouriKansasTexas Railroad  on September  that he may have witnessed The March was described by one of Joplin s biographers as a special early essay in ragtime[]  While in Sedalia he was teaching piano to students who included future ragtime composersArthur Marshall  Brun Campbell  and Scott Hayden []  In turn Joplin enrolled at theGeorge R Smith College  where he apparently studied advanced harmony and composition The College records were destroyed in a fire in []  and biographer Edward A Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for AfricanAmericans would be able to provide such a course[] [] [] In  Joplin married Belle the sisterinlaw of collaborator Scott Hayden  Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the Maple Leaf Rag was published Joplin was not far behind His first published ragOriginal Rags  had been completed in  the same year as the first ragtime work in print theMississippi Rag by William Krell  The Maple Leaf Rag was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in  Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around []  The exact circumstances that led to the Maple Leaf Rag s publication are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers Joplin signed a contract on August   withJohn Stillwell Stark  a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a  royalty on all sales of the rag with a minimum sales price of  cents[]  With the inscription To the Maple Leaf Club prominently visible along the top of at least some editions it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club although there is no direct evidence to prove the link and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time[]     Scott Joplin House  in St Louis Missouri  There have been many claims about the sales of theMaple Leaf Rag for example that Joplin was the first musician to sell  million copies of a piece of instrumental music[]  Joplin s first biographerRudi Blesh  wrote that during its first six months the piece sold  copies and became the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America[]  However research by Joplin s later biographer Edward A Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case the initial printrun of  took one year to sell and under the terms of Joplin s contract with a  royalty would have given Joplin an income of  or approximately at current prices Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses In  estimated sales would have given him an income of  annually approximately in current prices[] The Maple Leaf Rag did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers especially in the development of classic ragtime[]  After the publication of theMaple Leaf Rag Joplin was soon being described as King of rag time writers not least by himself[]  on the covers of his own work such asThe Easy Winners  and Elite Syncopations After the Joplins moved to St Louis  in early  they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth Joplin s relationship with his wife was difficult as she had no interest in music They eventually separated and then divorced[]  About this time Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags[]  It was in St Louis that Joplin produced some of his bestknown works includingThe Entertainer  March Majestic and the short theatrical work The Ragtime Dance In June  Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock Arkansas  the young woman to whom he had dedicatedThe Chrysanthemum She died on September   of complications resulting from a cold ten weeks after their wedding[]  Joplin s first work copyrighted after Freddie s death Bethena  was described by one biographer as an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtimewaltzes [] During this time Joplin created an opera company of  people and produced his first operaA Guest of Honor  for a national tour It is not certain how many productions were staged or even if this was an allblack show or a racially mixed production During the tour either inSpringfield Illinois  orPittsburg Kansas  someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts Joplin could not meet the company s payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house It is believed that the score forA Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of nonpayment of the company s boarding house bill[] Later years[edit ]     Front cover of the Wall Street Rag  sheet music In  Joplin moved to New York City which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera After his move to New York Joplin met Lottie Stokes whom he married in []  In  unable to find a publisher Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishingTreemonisha  himself in pianovocal format In  as a lastditch effort to see it performed he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall inHarlem  Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment it was a miserable failure to a public not ready for crude black musical formsso different from the European grand opera of that time[]  The audience including potential backers was indifferent and walked out[]  Scott writes that after a disastrous single performance  Joplin suffered a breakdown He was bankrupt discouraged and worn out He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles Treemonisha went unnoticed and unreviewed largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music a field closed to African Americans[]  In fact it was not until the s that the opera received a full theatrical stagingIn  Joplin and Lottie selfpublished his Magnetic Rag  as the Scott Joplin Music Company which he had formed the previous December[]  Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due tosyphilis  and was consciously racing against time In her sleeve notes on the Deutsche Grammophon  release of Treemonisha  she notes that he plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera day and night with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts page by page as each page of the full score was completed[] Death[edit ]By  Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilis  and a resulting descent into insanity[] []  In January  he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital  a mental institution[]  He died there on April  of syphilitic dementia at the age of [] []  and was buried in a pauper s grave that remained unmarked for  years His grave at Saint Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in []

music and Joplin s natural ability has been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended AfricanAmerican musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the sragtime [] When Joplin was learning the piano serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs cranked out by the tunesmiths ofTin Pan Alley []  As a composer Joplin refined ragtime elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the wandering honkytonk pianists playing mere dance music of popular imagination[]  This new art form the classic rag  combined AfroAmerican folk music ssyncopation  and thcentury European romanticism  with its harmonic schemes and its marchlike tempos[] []  In the words of one critic Ragtime was basically an AfroAmerican version of the polka or its analog theSousa style march[]  With this as a foundation Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them without improvisation[]  Joplin wrote his rags as classical music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its cheap bordello origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as  more tuneful contrapuntal infectious and harmonically colorful than any others of his era[] Some speculate that Joplin s achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacherJulius Weiss  who may have brought a polka  rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the year old Joplin[]  As Curtis put it The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware[] Joplin s first and most significant hit the Maple Leaf Rag was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least  years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns melody lines and harmony[]  though with the exception of Joseph Lamb  they generally failed to enlarge upon it[] Treemonisha[edit ]    Treemonisha    Main article Treemonisha  The opera s setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin s childhood town Texarkana in September  The plot centers on an year old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps  nest when her friend Remus rescues her The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader[] [] [] Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias ensembles and choruses In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident inTreemonisha are common in the operatic tradition and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composerRichard Wagner  of which Joplin was aware A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from inDie Walkre  and the retelling of the heroine s origins echos aspects of the operaSiegfried  In addition AfricanAmerican folk tales also influence the storythe wasp nest incident is similar to the story ofBr er Rabbit  and the briar patch[] Treemonisha is not a ragtime operabecause Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly using them to convey racial character and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the th century The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late th century recreated by a skilled and sensitive participant[] Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin s own life He notes that Lottie Joplin the composer s third wife saw a connection between the character Treemonisha s wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer In addition it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie Joplin s second wife because the date of the opera s setting was likely to have been the month of her birth[] At the time of the opera s publication in  the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as an entirely new form of operatic art[]  Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history with its heroine a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement[]  Curtis s conclusion is similar In the end Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy learning hard work and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race[]  Berlin describes it as a fine opera certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States but later states that Joplin s own libretto showed the composer was not a competent dramatist with the book not up to the quality of the music[] Performance skills[edit ]Pleasant Moments Ragtime Waltz played by Scott Joplin April   Sorry your browser either has JavaScript disabled or

Sedalia  newspaper in  and fellow ragtime composersArthur Marshall  and Joe Jordan  both said that he played the instrument well[]  However the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper rather than at the pianoArtie Matthews  recalled the delight the St Louis players took in outplaying Joplin[] While Joplin never made an audio recording his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls  for use in mechanical player pianos  All seven were made in  Of these the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing[]  probably by William Axtmann the staff arranger at Connorized[]  Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St Louis he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearlyall symptoms of thesyphilis  that took his life in []  Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of Maple Leaf Rag on the UniRecord label from June  as shocking disorganized and completely distressing to hear[]  While there is disagreement among pianoroll experts about the accuracy of the reproduction of a player s performance[] [] [] []  Berlin notes that the Maple Leaf Rag roll was painfully bad and likely to be the truest record of Joplin s playing at the time The roll however does not reflect his abilities earlier in life[] Legacy[edit ]     Nonpareil  Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes changing American musical taste Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties  Joplin s ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America[] Joshua Rifkin  a leading Joplin recording artist wrote A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work and even at his most highspirited he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity  He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him[]  Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety  Joplin did for the rag whatChopin  did for themazurka  His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated thebolero  and the tango []  Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin s music had helped to revolutionise American music and culture by removing Victorian restraint[] Composer and actor Max Morath  found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin s work did not enjoy the popularity of theMaple Leaf Rag because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his lifetime[]  Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin opined thatMaple Leaf Rag would make him  King of Ragtime Composers  but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime  When I m dead twentyfive years people are going to recognize me  he told a friend Just over thirty years later he was recognized and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin[] Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music And as a pioneer composer and performer he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of both races After his death jazz historian Floyd Levin noted Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers the man who gave America a genuine native music[] Revival[edit ]After his death in  Joplin s music and ragtime in general waned in popularity as new forms of musical styles such asjazz  and novelty piano  emerged Even so jazz bands and recording artists such asTommy Dorsey  in Jelly Roll Morton  in  and J Russell Robinson  in  released recordings of Joplin compositionsMaple Leaf Rag was the Joplin piece found most often on rpm  records[] In the s a smallscale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars such as Trebor TichenorWilliam Bolcom  William Albright  and Rudi Blesh  Audiophile Records  released a two record setThe Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin The Greatest of Ragtime Composers performed by Knocky Parker  in [] In  Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin  a young musicologist in the body of Joplin s work Together they hosted an occasional ragtimeandearlyjazz evening onWBAI  radio[]  In November  Rifkin released a recording calledScott Joplin Piano Rags []  on the classical  label Nonesuch  It sold  copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch s first millionselling record[]  The Billboard BestSelling Classical LPs chart for September   has the record at number  with the followup Volume  at number  and a combined set of both volumes at number  Separately both volumes had been on the chart for  weeks In the top  spots on that chart  of the entries were recordings of Joplin s work three of which were Rifkin s[]  Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section The album was nominated in  for twoGrammy Award  categories Best Album Notes  and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance without orchestra  Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin but at the ceremony on March   Rifkin did not win in any category[]  He did a tour in  which included appearances on BBC  Television and a sellout concert at London sRoyal Festival Hall []  In Alan Rich  in the New York Magazine  wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin s music on diskNonesuch Records  created almost alone the Scott Joplin revival[] In January  Harold C Schonberg  music critic at

catalyst for classical music scholars the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life to conclude that Joplin was a genius[]  Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library  published a

RecordsMore Scott Joplin Rags in  and The Road From Rags To Jazz in In  film producer George Roy Hill  contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately asking each man to write the score for a film project he was working onThe Sting  Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments Instead Hill foundMarvin Hamlisch  available and brought him into the project as composer[]  Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin s music for theThe Sting for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation  on April  []  His version of The Entertainer reached number  on theBillboard Hot   and the American Top   music chart on May  [] []  prompting The New York Times  to write The whole nation has begun to take notice[]  Thanks to the film and its score Joplin s work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world becoming in the words of music magazineRecord World  the classical phenomenon of the decade[]  Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin s style and his band adaptations from Schuller s style[]  Schuller said Hamlisch got the Oscar for music he didn t write since it is by Joplin and arrangements he didn t write and  editions  he didn t make A lot of people were upset by that but that s show biz[] On October   excerpts from Treemonisha were presented in concert form atLincoln

2014-07-05 17:32:28 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex The Metro  by Josef Essberger  The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual  That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement  but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris   Yet there was clearly something strange about the case  It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification  for it was fully clothed and none of the owner s personal effects had been removed  save of course for his head  The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man s wallet with forensic evidence from the body  Added to that  Madame Charente  the dead man s wife  could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways   She had already reported her husband as missing    A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm  dark tunnels on either side of Od on station  where the body had been found  Above ground another search was made  equally fruitlessly  and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved   Two weeks later  four kilometres away in the west  a headless body was found at Courcelles station  again in the tunnel not far from the platform  As in the earlier case  the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head  which appeared to have been done with some precision  Again  the body was fully clothed and easily identified  and nothing but the head had apparently been removed    What can I tell these blessed reporters   Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home   They want answers for everything  And it s not just the papers now  the politicians are getting worried too  I m reporting to the Pr fet on this one     If there were instant answers for everything  mon petit chou  they d have no need of you   said Madame Dutruelle   And where would they be without you  Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year  and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot    The little inspecteur divisionnaire chef pulled in his stomach  puffed out his chest and rose to his full height  A smile spread across his round face  In his smart dark suit and gold rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris s most successful policemen    Just think   he said wryly   they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation     They re fools  all of them     All the same  my dear  I don t know where to go on this one  There re no leads  There s no apparent motive  And it s a bizarre pattern  Assuming  of course  it is a pattern  We can t be sure of that until there s been another    Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge  A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed    It s another one  sir   said the voice at the other end    Another what     It s identical  Another headless corpse  just like the others   male  middle aged  white     Where   asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette    Ch teau Rouge     In the Metro     Yes sir  just inside the tunnel  In the anti suicide well between the tracks     Close the line   if you haven t already  I ll be with you soon  And don t move it  d you hear    Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room    I hate these early morning cases   he muttered  He lit his cigarette    Have a coffee before you go  Another dead body will keep     But we ve closed the line  And it s the other side of town  my dear  North Paris     All the same    He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee  Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty six whose long  thin lipped face was framed by stern grey hair  Her strong  practical hands were country hands  and she had never got used to city life  She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyren es  Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again  Poor Agnes  She tried so hard to please him  How could she know that he longed to be free of her  How could she possibly know of Vololona  the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case  For him it had been love at first sight    And for me too  my darling   Vololona had been quick to agree  her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked   a veritable coup de foudre   She spoke French well  with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise  Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man  but he was careful to tell no one except Monsieur Ch baut  his closest friend  about the source of his happiness    I ve never felt like this before  Pierre  I m captivated by her   he said one evening when he took Monsieur Ch baut to see Vololona dancing   It was a rare experience  even for the jaded Monsieur Ch baut  In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar  Her black limbs lashed the air to the music  which was raw and sensual    You know  Pierre  in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful  Well  you know that already  There was always my work  and the children  and I was happy enough at home  It never occured to me to look at another woman  But something happened when I met Vololona  She showed me how to live  She showed me what real ecstasy is  Look at her  Pierre  Isn t she the most exquisite thing you ever saw  And she adores me  She s crazy about me  But why  I ask you  What can she see in me   three times her age  pot bellied  bald       married    Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows  He smiled proudly to himself  He knew exactly what was on their minds  Life was strange  he thought  and you could never tell  Some of them were young men  tall and handsome and virile  yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her   Monsieur Ch baut finished his whisky    I can see   he said   that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris   Monsieur Ch baut was a lawyer    You re a cynic  Pierre     And after thirty years in the force you re not     Personally  I believe her when she says she loves me  I just don t know why  Another whisky     Well  one thing s for sure  R gis  it can t go on like that  One way or another things ll come to a head  But I must agree  she s exquisite all right  Like an exquisite Venus fly trap  And at the germane moment  you know  those soft  succulent petals will close around you like a vice    The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend s unreasonable attitude    How can you say that   he snapped   When you haven t even spoken to her     But all women are the same  R gis  Don t you know that  You should be a lawyer  then you d know it  They can t help it  they re built that way  Believe me  it can t go on without something happening    Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing  Monsieur Ch baut could see he had touched a raw nerve  He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder    Look R gis  all I m saying is  be careful  you haven t got my experience    Of course  that was true  When it came to women few men had Monsieur Ch baut s experience  Or his luck  for that matter  He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties  He crossed roads without looking  He did not hurry for trains  He never reconciled bank accounts  Tall  slim  with boyish good looks and thick  black  wavy hair  he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle    Look  you ve got two women involved  R gis   Monsieur Ch baut continued   and women aren t like us  Agnes isn t stupid  She must know something s going on     She hasn t said anything   said the Inspector brusquely  He lit another Gauloise    Of course she hasn t  She s cleverer than you are  She intends to keep you     Mind you   said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly   she has had some odd dreams recently   so she says  About me and another woman  But anyway  she just laughs and says she can t believe it     But R gis  you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same     Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something  if only out of decency    Monsieur Ch baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips    No   he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector   never  you must never tell her   coute R gis  even if she did mention it  you must deny everything  Even if she caught the two of you in the act  you must deny it  You can only tell a woman there s another when you ve definitively made up your mind to leave her  and even then it may not be safe     So much for logic     It s no use looking for logic in women  R gis  I told you  they re not like men  In fact  I ve come to the conclusion that they re not even the same species as men  Men and women aren t like dog and bitch  they re more like dog and cat  C est bizarre  non  In any case  I do know you can t keep two women on the go without something happening  I don t know what  but something    Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Pr fecture de police  Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings  and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them  They wanted constantly to know more  So of course did Inspector Dutruelle    I assure you  gentlemen   he told a press conference   we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts  We are doing everything possible  You can tell your readers that wherever they are  we ll find them     Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers   asked one of the foreign reporters    So as we know which heads we re looking for   added a journalist from London   It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris  Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated  Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations  Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances  Even the beggars  who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages  had gone  And the few passengers who remained sat more long faced than ever  or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms   Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up  His mind  already excited over Vololona  was now in a turmoil  Vololona had suddenly  and tearfully  announced that she was pregnant  Then  having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy   but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic   she told him one day on the telephone   I thought you were going to ask me to marry you   Inspector Dutruelle was stunned    But you know I m married  ma ch rie   he said    I thought you d leave Agnes   she replied   I wanted to be with you  I wanted to share everything with you       my child       my life       my bed   Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing    But darling  we can still see each other     No  it s too painful  I love you too much    Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all  Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona  he longed to be with her  If only Agnes would leave him  And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already   the dinners  the presents  the apartment  Why did women have to possess you  It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took  until there was nothing left to give but yourself  Perhaps Pierre was right after all  when you thought about it   The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally  Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect  no leads  no motive  His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity   It appears   commented France Soir   that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer   The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector  and they felt leaderless and demoralised  It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact  that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common   their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart  and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them   Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport  and he especially did not like the Metro  It was cramped  smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times  and in the summer it was hot  You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station  It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro    I can t take much more of this  Marc  he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him   it s too hot  We ll get off at the next stop     That s Barbes Rochechouart  sir  We can change there     No  Marc  We can get out there  Someone else can take a sauna  I ve had enough  Anyway  we need to have a look around   Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow  He sounded irritable   God knows what it s like normally   he added   When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart    At least we can get through now   said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator    How d you mean   asked Inspector Dutruelle    Well  normally this station s packed   beggars  passengers  buskers  hawkers  plus all their tables and stalls  It s like a damn great fair and market rolled into one  You can get anything here  from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes   not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin     Oh  yes   said Inspector Dutruelle  vaguely   I remember   He passed a handkerchief across his brow again   At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle s hand  Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight  the Inspector read aloud    Professor Dhiakobli  Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life          He broke off in mid sentence with a snort    What a lot of mumbo jumbo  Headless chickens and voodoo magic     It may be mumbo jumbo to you  sir   said the Detective Constable with a laugh   but round here they take that sort of thing seriously  And not only round here   after all  we use some of these techniques in the police  don t we     Oh really  Such as     Well  graphology for a start   you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone s handwriting scientific  can you sir  Or what about astrology   employing people on the basis of the stars  Or numerology     Yes  Marc   said Inspector Dutruelle  pushing the card into his top pocket   maybe you re right  and maybe when you re older you won t be so sure  Now get on the blower and call the car    The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August  No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro  and the media  bored with the lack of developments  left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity  Paris  deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast  was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro  Then  in September  the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal   But Inspector Dutruelle s passion for Vololona did not cool with the season  Vololona had at last agreed to see him  occasionally  but she always managed  with tears in her eyes  to deflect his more amorous advances  For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment  but he was growing increasingly frustrated  The notion that she had another lover obsessed him  and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin  Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door  as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees  Now  denied the one thing here he wanted  the scene filled him with dismay  Money and music were in the air  Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways  Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini skirts hurried to work  Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon lit video clubs  Somewhere deep below ran the Metro  but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that  His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things  Sometimes he would stay all night  leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night s revelries  Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes  but he never once saw her on the arm of another man  or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor   One night  late in October  he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight  Madame Dutruelle  having been told that her husband was working on a case  and perhaps believing it  was already asleep  Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair  for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes  the sort of man who irons his shoelaces  But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor  Muttering to himself  the Inspector bent and picked it up  and as he did so something fell from the top pocket  He gazed at it blankly for a moment  Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station  a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners  but still legible  He picked it up and slowly started to read   PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life  luck  love  marriage  attraction of clients  examinations  sexual potency  If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another  this is his domain  you will be loved and your partner will return  Prof  Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog  He

B   th floor  door on left Metro  Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again   All problems resolved        It was preposterous  And yet  it was tempting  What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed  After all  everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it   Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris s eighteenth arrondissement  an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa  It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way  cursing because he had not brought his umbrella  The door to number   b was swinging in the wind  its dark paint peeling badly  He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth floor door on which a brass plaque read   Professor Dhiakobli Sp cialiste des travaux occultes Please ring   He stood there  breathing heavily from the stairs  and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared    Please enter  my dear sir   said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy   I am Dhiakobli  And I have the honour to meet           As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined  Professor Dhiakobli was black  He had a short yet commanding figure  and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit  A large  silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket    For the moment   said Inspector Dutruelle   my name is hardly important  I ve only come in response to your advertisement     Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help  A minor indiscretion  Please be seated  sir  and let us talk about the matter    Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large  well upholstered chair to which he had been directed  Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk  on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging  its wide  moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer    Ah  I see that Zeus approves of you   said the Professor  stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers  his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle   Poor Zeus  mon petit papillon  he is devoted to me  but he must remain here whenever I leave France  And you are fortunate  monsieur  It is only now that I return from C te d Ivoire  It is my country you know  I return there for a few months each summer  Paris in summer is so disagreeable  don t you agree    Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success  The frames of his glasses  the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left  the gem studded rings on his fingers   all were of gold  From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man  Around him the large room was like a shrine  Heavy curtains excluded the daylight  the only illumination was a small brass desklamp  and the dark  red walls were festooned with spears  costumes  photographs and other African memorabilia  There was a sweet smell in the air  and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator  You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris    As I say   began Inspector Dutruelle  ignoring the Professor s question   I saw your card and I wondered just how you work     And may one enquire as to monsieur s little difficulty    Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could    Well     he coughed again    first of all  I wondered what sort of things you can help people with    The Professor s eyebrows rose    Anything   he said slowly  his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin   My dear sir  anything at all     And then  I wondered  how do you operate  That s to say  what exactly do you do       and how do you charge     Ah monsieur  let us not talk of money  First I must learn just how I can help you  And for that a consultation is in order    Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat    And what would a consultation involve  What does it       cost    Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably    Mon cher monsieur  I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money  I too recoil at the mere thought of it  It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune  And if some donate a small token of their gratitude  who am I to refuse their offering  They pay according to their means  to assist those who have little to offer  But for a preliminary consultation  monsieur  a nominal sum  as a mark of good faith  is usually in order  For a gentleman of your obvious standing  a trifle  a mere two hundred francs  And let me assure you  monsieur  of my absolute discretion  Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls   He paused  Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin   They have the sanctity of the confessional     I m glad to hear it   said the Inspector    But monsieur still has the advantage of me        continued Professor Dhiakobli   Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking  He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier  a Parisien wine merchant  and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul  He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients  of their instant and passionate love for one another  of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him  and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave  Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits  end and now even his business was suffering  He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret  The Professor listened intently  asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments  Finally Inspector Dutruelle said   Well  Professor Dhiakobli  I think that s all I can tell you  I don t think I can tell you any more  From what I have told you  do you believe you can help me    For a long time there was silence  The Professor appeared to be in another world  He stared at Inspector Dutruelle  but seemed to be looking through him    My dear Monsieur Mazodier   he said at last  very slowly  almost mechanically   the story you have told me is most poignant  Each of us has a hidden corner in his life  a jardin secret  Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours  Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women  At the mercy of their complex physical structure  is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures  I help them find their lost ones  their partners of many years  to recreate again the rapport of their youth  You will understand that it is not easy  But this is my work  My domain     So you can t help me   said Inspector Dutruelle  adding despondently   Perhaps what I really need is a head shrink    The Professor gave a start  Again  for a long time he did not answer  Then his teeth flashed in the dimness     coutez monsieur  this is my work  my domain   he repeated   Certainly I can help you  But you must understand that it will not be easy  It calls for a special ceremony  In the first place  you are married  and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women  In the second  we are both men of the world  monsieur  and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages  And finally  it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic  You know  the magic of Madagascar is very strong  No  monsieur  it will not be easy  Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone  Sometimes        He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye  his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant   Sometimes   he said   we must make sacrifices     What sort of sacrifices   asked Inspector Dutruelle dully    Oh  my dear sir  you must leave that to me  But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs   His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath   You must not concern yourself with technicalities  monsieur  Your mind must be fixed on the future  on the life you have dreamed of  You must envisage your wife   happy in the arms of another  You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for       secure in your arms       sharing your life       your days       your nights  The perfect solution to all your problems  Is it not worth a considerable sum     It certainly would be worth a lot        Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor s words came to life in his mind    Shall we say thirty thousand francs     I m sorry   muttered the Inspector    Let s say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards   the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken   Do you see  monsieur  how confident I am of success    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was confused  He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt  or to propose quite so generous a token  But it did not seem to matter  After all  what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately  And  in any case  at worst it was only fifteen thousand   The Professor s eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle    Of course  monsieur  I have faith in your gratitude  I know that you will not forget  in your delight  that what I have done  I can undo  And now  monsieur  you must not allow me to detain you further  We have much work to do  In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy  And with some little articles of clothing  something close to their thoughts  say a scarf or a hat  You can arrange this    Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly    Excellent  monsieur  I must know them in every detail   if I am to have a spiritual t te   t te with each of them  So  in fifteen days  you will return for the ceremony  It will take place beyond those curtains  in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits  Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there  but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day  It must be at dawn  and you must come without fail   the ceremony cannot be deferred  Can you manage six in the morning  shall we say Monday the sixteenth    Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December  At four o clock in the morning he got out of bed  Though his wife stirred she did not wake  He showered and dressed  His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen  boiling water for his coffee  He drank two cups  strong and black  but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam  He lit a Gauloise and paced the room  Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing  finishing his cigarette  Below him the courtyard was dark and silent  and above him the sky was black  But away in the east  through the open end of the court  a violet hue was creeping over Paris  He glanced at his watch  It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car  It would seem strange  leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver  He wondered what the concierge would make of it all   she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor  He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut   Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything  He looked into the bedroom  Gently  he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept  her arms clasped about her knees  He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek  Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him  switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen  and opened the front door  As he did so the telephone rang  It startled him and he cursed aloud  He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake    Inspector Dutruelle   said the voice at the other end    Yes  what is it     Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning  Monsieur l Inspecteur  It s the Pr fecture     Never mind the time   said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey   I m off duty today     Well  that s the point  Inspector  The Pr fet s ordered us to call you specially  He appreciates you re not on duty  but he wants you anyway     It s quite impossible     I m afraid he insists  sir     Why     He insists you come on duty immediately  sir  We re sending a car round for you     Yes  yes  I understand  but why     It s the Metro again  sir     The Metro     Yes  sir  They ve found another corpse on the line  decapitated again    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was cursing to himself  He was cursing the Pr fet  the police  this homicidal maniac  his wife  Why today  Why ever today    Sir  Hello sir  The car ll be with you in five minutes     Yes  all right  I ll be ready in five minutes    The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf  Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine  His dreams  it seemed  were evaporating just as surely    You d better brief me on this as quick as you can   he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car   Where was the body found     Barbes Rochechouart  sir    A cold shiver passed through the Inspector    I presume it s the same as the others   he asked    Well  in as much as there s nothing to go on  it s the same  sir  Otherwise it couldn t be more different  For a start  we ve just heard they ve found two of them now  And this time they re women  One white  in her forties  and one black  A young black girl   still in her teens  by the look of things    But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening  He was staring blankly through the glass to his right  and as they turned at Place du Ch telet the empty streets were no more than a cold  grey blur to him  The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de S bastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart  It was the route he should have been taking in his own car   Outside the station  now closed to passengers  people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up  Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car  He hesitated  He glanced towards Rue Beldamme  just a stone s throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart  where the Professor would be waiting for him  He shrugged and went down the station steps   Underground  on the number four line  there was an air of gloom  Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train drivers through that morning  Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one  It was the body of a middle aged woman  quite unexceptional  coarse and wiry  like his wife    She s forty seven  Monsieur l Inspecteur   said somebody beside him   French  Name of Madame Catherine Dubur  Not like the other one     The other one   said the Inspector blankly    I told you in the car  sir   said the Detective Sergeant at his ear   there s two of them     You d better show me    They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track  A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body  which lay on its back  Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff  black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines  Suddenly he shuddered in alarm  Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona    Identity   he asked  He tried to control his voice    We don t know  sir   this is all we found   said a policeman  handing him a tattered greetings card  Inside  in large  green handwriting  were the words   Happy Nineteenth Birthday  from Everyone in Antananarivo     D you think she s Malagasy  sir   asked the policeman  The Inspector shrugged his shoulders  then held out an open hand    Your torch  please   he said   He played its beam over the body  up and down the long  slender legs  across the clothes  At least he did not recognise the clothes  Yet the body s size  its build  its colour  everything pointed to Vololona  He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him  He stood up in relief  That was certainly not Vololona  Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her   and the other of Agnes  for that matter  Even the ages were the same   He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse  He could not understand  Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere  And what of Agnes  How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that  How could he explain it  when you came to think of it  When you came to think of it  he had explained very little  He had been happy enough to take the money  and free enough with his words   all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual t te   t tes        Inspector Dutruelle gasped    The devil   he muttered to himself  Suddenly he understood everything    The what  sir   said somebody beside him    Never mind   he answered quietly  putting his hand to his breast pocket  His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions  He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise  Through its curling blue smoke  back lit by the lights of the train  the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance  while beside him men s voices were thrumming in his ear  Why was there no time to think  to extricate himself from this nightmare  He cursed himself  How could he have been so stupid  He cursed his wife and Vololona  And Professor Dhiakobli  What madness had driven him to this  Then he cursed himself again  and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side    What time is it     Six fifteen  sir    For a moment  he hesitated  Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body     coute Guy  when he s got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up   he said   Now get me the Pr fet    The Pr fet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep  and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation    Are you insane  man  You re in the middle of an investigation     The investigation is over  Monsieur le Pr fet     So  you have the killer at last     In fifteen minutes  monsieur  in fifteen minutes     Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty

units who require prolonged care after an acute illness Predicting use of these facilities may help hospitals improve resource management expenditures and quality of care delivered in intensive careObjective To develop a predictive tool for early identification of intensive care patients with increased probability of transfer to such a hospitalMethods Data on  adults admitted to intensive care at a tertiary care hospital between January  and June  were retrospectively reviewed The prediction model was developed by using multiple ordinal logistic regression The model was internally validated via the bootstrapping technique and externally validated with a control cohort of  intensive care patientsResults Among the study group  patients  were discharged to longterm acute care hospitals and   to home or other care facilities   died in the intensive care unit The final prediction algorithm showed good accuracy biascorrected concordance index   CI  excellent calibration and external validation concordance index   CI  Hypoalbuminemia was the greatest potential driver of increased likelihood of discharge to a longterm acute care hospital Other important predictors were intensive care unit category older age extended hospital stay before admission to intensive care severe pressure ulcers admission source and dependency on mechanical ventilationConclusions This new predictive tool can help estimate on the first day of admission to intensive care the likelihood of a patients discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalThe economic impact of and demand for critical care services in the United States are intensifying From  to  annual critical care expenditures increased from  billion to  billion  In  critical care services accounted for approximately  of national health care expenditures and  of the US gross domestic product  Part of the increased costs and demand for intensive care unit ICU services are due to a subgroup of critically ill patients who survive acute illness and require prolonged lifesupport care   These patients also termed chronically critically ill represent a problem of growing importance Chronically critically ill patients account for only  to  of all ICU admissions but for approximately  of total ICU expenditures   The increasing costs and demand for critical care services in the United States have resulted in greater emphasis on efficient ICU resource management and improvement in quality of care    Development of care practices for chronically critically ill patients is a considerable challenge not only for ICU clinicians but also for the health system as a whole  Changes in reimbursement and the continued increase in the number of chronically critically ill patients have increased pressures on acute care hospitals to reduce the length of stay and cost of care  Longterm acute care hospitals LTACHs are facilities that have recently emerged in response to the demand for prolonged care after an acute illness  These facilities offer multiple benefits to patients and acute care hospitals including reduction of underreimbursed costs more efficient ICU bed procurement and improvement of benchmarking measurements     As a result the utilization and number of LTACHs have been increasing at a high rate Our primary objective in this study was to develop a predictive algorithm for early identification of ICU patients with a high probability of discharge to an LTACH We hypothesized that sufficient accuracy could be achieved by using predictor variables that were available within the first  hours of ICU admission Formerly no such predictive instrument has existed Although experienced ICU clinicians may use various clinical characteristics and laboratory results to estimate the future need for LTACH transfer this clinical assessment can be influenced by multiple biases  A predictive tool permits the clinical care team to make decisions based on and supported by objective data rather than subjective intuition Individualized prediction of discharge to an LTACH may allow for strategic planning to improve ICU resource management and quality of care In addition early and objective identification of ICU patients with the greatest likelihood of LTACH transfer could facilitate LTACH referrals encourage preparation of patients and their families and decrease financial issues for the patients and the hospitalsIncreased costs for ICU services come in part from the chronically critically illPrevious Section  Next Section  MethodsSample SelectionThis retrospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center with  adult ICU beds Approval was granted by the appropriate institutional review board informed consent was not required Data for development of the model were obtained from the medical records of  patients  years or older who had been admitted to an ICU between January  and June VariablesA team of clinicians and research staff developed a list of  demographic ICU admission and medical variables that they thought had empirical or theoretical relevance to discharge to an LTACH seeTable  Demographic variables included age sex and body mass index ICU admission was summarized by  variables length of stay before ICU admission source of admission ICU category and type of ICU admission Length of stay before ICU admission was defined as the number of days the patient stayed in the hospital directly before being admitted to the ICU Source of admission was the site from which the patient was transferred to the ICU  the emergency department  the hospital unit or operating room or  a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or an other hospital ICU category was defined as the admitting ICU cardiovascular coronary heart failure medical neurosurgical surgical Type of ICU admission indicated whether or not the admission was planned or anticipated by the care team ie discussed in notes before the admission or treatment intervention The remaining  physiological and laboratory variables were measures of medical status during the first  hours of ICU admission The response variable discharge disposition was collapsed into  categories LTACH home or other care facilities ie nonLTACH and death in the ICU Other care facilities encompassed skilled nursing facilities as well as acute and chronic rehabilitation facilitiesView this table   In this window    In a new window  Table Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis of model development cohortStatistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version  SAS Institute Inc and R statistical software version  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Univariate analyses to compare the LTACH group with the nonLTACH and ICUdeath groups were performed by using the MannWhitney test Pearson  test or Fisher exact test as appropriate Differences were considered significant atP   With all  established variables see Table  a multiple ordinal logistic regression model was developed to predict the outcome of LTACH discharge A simultaneous approach ie all variables entered at a single step was implemented rather than a stepwise procedure for analysis as recommended by Harrell et al  Missing data in the development cohort were estimated by using themice multivariate imputation by chained equations function in R statistical software generating several imputations by using Gibbs sampling  The coefficients from the resulting multiple logistic regression model were used to construct a paperbased graphic calculation tool called a nomogram by using the design library of R statistical software Points for each predictor were determined by rescaling the regression coefficients to adapt to a userfriendly point scale Variable importance in the final model was ascertained from the relative potential contribution of points as deduced from the nomogram and the length of the axis Variables with longer axes have greater potential predictive effect in the modelInternal validation of the model with the original development data was determined by using the bootstrapping technique to correct for overfitting bias  During this process a random bootstrap sample of the original data was generated from the cohort and the model was applied to this sample to yield predicted results  This technique was repeated  times to obtain a biascorrected estimate of the models predictive accuracy Discrimination of the model was quantified by using the concordance index ie the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve The concordance index ranges from  random discrimination to  perfect discrimination and represents the ability of the model to accurately assign a higher probability to the patient discharged to LTACH for a randomly selected pair of patients with one discharged to LTACH and the other not Typically predictive tests are considered of clinical value when the concordance index is greater than    Calibration an additional measure of model performance illustrates how well the models predictions agree with the observed outcomes Calibration was assessed graphically by plotting predicted vs actual probabilities for discharge to LTACH A model with perfect predictions generates a calibration curve that lies on the  lineTwentyone variables that had empirical or theoretical relevance to longterm acute care were usedThe predictive tool was externally validated with an independent cohort of  ICU patients at the same institution admitted between January  and March  The sample size of the validation cohort was estimated to provide greater than  statistical power to conclude a concordance index of the validation data set assumed to be approximately  on the basis of the data for the development cohort is significantly greater than  Discrimination of the model on the external validation sample was quantified with the concordance index and calibration was assessed graphicallyUsing the nomogram Figure   to calculate the predicted probability of LTACH discharge requires the following steps  locate the patients category or value on the axis corresponding to the respective predictor variable  draw a vertical line upward to the points axis to determine how many points are assigned for that characteristic in the model  repeat this process for the remaining predictor variable axes determining the points for each predictor independently  sum the points achieved for all predictors  locate this summed point value on the total points axis and draw a vertical line down to the probability axis to calculate the patients predicted probability of having the models primary end point ie discharge to an LTACH  View larger version   In this window    In a new window  Figure  Nomogram for discharge to a longterm

were discharged home or to other care facilities   died in the ICU The median ICU length of stay for patients transferred to an LTACH was  days thth percentile [interquartile range]  days Conversely patients discharged home or to other care facilities had a median ICU length of stay of  days interquartile range  days P   and patients who died in the ICU had a median ICU length of stay of  days

the other discharge groups home or other care facilities   of  patients death in the ICU   of  patients emphasizing the disparity in hospital resources required by an LTACH discharge patient TheTable

neurosurgical ICU older age ie  years extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission ie  days presence of stage  or higher pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early dependency on mechanical ventilation also contribute substantial points  points or higher to the model increasing the predicted probability of LTACH discharge Only extreme values of PaO serum levels of creatinine or total bilirubin or platelet count contribute any meaningful amounts to the predicted risk Sex and requirements for dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine during the first  hours of ICU admission have minor impacts on the prediction of discharge to an LTACH ie contributed a relatively small number of points to the nomogram total score

validation data setPrevious Section  Next Section  DiscussionWe used demographic ICU admission and ICU clinical data measured during the first  hours of ICU admission to construct and validate a predictive model for estimating future use of an LTACH The models discrimination and calibration in the development and validation cohorts indicate it makes it possible to accurately predict the likelihood of LTACH use among ICU patients The most potentially influential determinants of this outcome included hypoalbuminemia ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU older age extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission presence of severe pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early requirement for mechanical ventilation These findings confirm and extend those of previous investigations   which have shown that in addition to dependency on mechanical ventilation older age and greater severity of illness other considerations are important for assessing disposition of discharge from an ICUThe model shows a strong direct association between hypoalbuminemia and the likelihood of discharge to an LTACH This finding may be explained by the underlying nutritional status hepatic failure cirrhosis andor acute response to stress or sepsis among critically ill patients   Several studies   have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased mortality morbidity ICU length of stay and resource utilization in critically ill patients Scheinhorn et al  found that hypoalbuminemia was common among patients admitted to an LTACH and previous investigators   emphasized its importance in predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation and chronic critical illness ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU contribute substantial points to the models predicted risk for discharge to an LTACH This result most likely occurs because these noncardiovascular ICUs typically receive more unplanned critically ill ICU patients than does a cardiovascular ICU A majority of cardiovascular ICU admissions  in a cardiovascular ICU vs  in all other ICUs are planned temporary eg  hours ICU transfers immediately after surgery as a monitoring precaution before the patient is moved to a stepdown unit Finally the predictive value of deepwound pressure ulceration within the LTACH discharge model is supported by the results of other investigations    The frequency of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients is a result of multiple comorbid conditions inability to move impaired angiogenesis response and dependency on mechanical ventilation  Our results suggest that stage  or higher pressure ulcers early in the ICU admission are associated with a higher likelihood of discharge to an LTACHOur findings are especially relevant because of the current initiatives to improve care practices for patients who are chronically critically ill      Early identification of LTACH use may allow clinical care teams to make appropriate arrangements for patients care after discharge from the ICU improve the transition of care ensure bed availability and avoid potential delays in patients discharge As emphasized by Zimmerman et al  discharge planning started shortly after ICU admission allows for more efficient use of ICU resources Enhanced ICU bed utilization has a variety of clinical implications including potentially better outcomes and farreaching financial value Older age presence of severe pressure ulcers early mechanical ventilation are also predictors of discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalLTACHs may improve outcomes for chronically critically ill patients through specialized care These hospitals often embrace a multidisciplinary and rehabilitationbased approach to treatment providing a setting with experienced health professionals and ample clinical resources for the care of patients who are chronically critically ill     Votto et al  reported that the clinical outcomes including inhospital mortality and discharges to home were significantly better for patients transferred to an LTACH than for similar patients who remained in acute care hospitals Furthermore patients treated at an LTACH are less likely to be readmitted to an acute care hospital than are those treated in alternative care settings after discharge from an ICU In addition to potential clinical benefits financial advantages may exist that support the use of LTACHs for chronically critically ill patients Cost reduction by LTACHs has been achieved by focusing on efficient staff operation and incorporation of care protocols as well as service and resource standardization  Votto et al  compared costs between LTACHeligible patients transferred and not transferred to an LTACH and concluded that the mean total cost per patient at an LTACH   was less than that at an acute care hospital  In a study  of critically ill patients with tracheostomies total Medicare expenses related to the admission ie acute and postacute care were less for patients in an LTACH than for patients in other settings Conversely results of a study  examining Medicare claims for a variety of patient types indicated that although patients transferred to an LTACH had decreased costs in the acute setting their total cost of care was higher than that of patients discharged to other postacute care facilities eg skilled nursing facility rehabilitation facility Although evidence     indicates that LTACH utilization results in considerable cost savings for acute care hospitals the economic impact of LTACH facilities on US health care expenditures is still undeterminedUnfortunately evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of LTACH utilization to treat patients with longterm illnesses The current interpretation is primarily based on retrospective studies which may introduce multiple biases The economic impact of LTACH utilization and whether these facilities actually help improve the longterm outcomes of chronically critically ill patients must be properly evaluated If compelling evidence supports therapeutic benefits of LTACH usage implementation of interventions designed to discharge chronically critically ill patients to an LTACH would be a safe approach to providing critical care services in a costeffective wayOur study has some notable limitations Our development and validation cohorts were patients admitted to a single tertiary care institution a situation that may limit the applicability of the results In addition the retrospective design may have introduced ascertainment bias The study design also restricted our analysis to data contained within the electronic health records preventing us from including other factors known to influence LTACH utilization such as payer source patient and clinician preference LTACH discharge criteria bed availability and geographic limitations  Previous Section  Next Section  ConclusionsThis study was our first effort at developing a clinical instrument to predict early in a patients ICU admission the probability of that patients discharge to an LTACH We think that this predictive tool offers a valuable perspective for patients patients family members clinicians and hospitals When complemented by the clinicians judgment as well as feedback from patients and their family members this risk calculator has the potential to improve the quality of care delivered to chronically critically ill patients while enhancing ICU resource managementPrevious Section  Next

2014-07-05 17:32:29 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex   How to Avoid Burnout Are You Falling for This Myth   You want to earn a spot in your niche with your incredible range of insights and experience  So you work diligently by squeezing content creation in between meetings  calls  emails  professional projects  home projects  family time  and much more   You think you’re on a great track and you’ll never burn out as long as you keep up your momentum   Eventually  you start to stay a little later working on projects and even work on weekends  You begin worrying about whether it’s working or if you should hedge your bets with this whole writing thing    Never mind   you say  You still hold on to the idea that you will never burn out   giving up and in to burnout is for idle  non dedicated people who don’t share your vision or passion  Short of an uncontrollable disaster  all you have to do is keep up this momentum and your hard work will pay off in the end   right  Wrong   A Seemingly Never Ending Balancing Act  That phrase you keep repeating   I’ll never burn out   is a myth  This busywork that’s masquerading as  dedication  is the road to burnout  How do you know   Do any of the following statements apply to you        Bad  days are more frequent than good      Most of your time is spent on tasks that seem impossible or are monotonous      You’re exhausted   if not all of the time  most of the time      You don’t feel appreciated or what you do makes a difference      You feel unmotivated   you can’t see value in caring about your work or even home life      You’re overwhelmed by venturing into a new territory      You feel like you’re going nowhere   If none of these apply to you  feel free to skip to the end and share your secrets to burnout prevention  If any of these apply to you  even in the slightest increment  then you’re showing signs of burnout  In turn  this could be negatively affecting your ability to accomplish your goals and have serious physical repercussions  The time is now to deal with it because you have a lot to lose if burnout gets the best of you   It’s Time for a Time Out  To address and prevent burnout  you need to stop and take a step back  Consider not only how you got there  but how you will bail yourself out to replenish your energy to accomplish your greater goals  Use these tips       Take a break        I can’t slow down   I have all of these things to do   Once you’ve reached burnout status  it’s hard to break habits that either serve little value or perpetuate the burnout balancing act  Slow down  This isn’t a request  Do it  Where you can  cut back on commitments that show little value and ask for help or delegate tasks  such as asking someone to proofread your content for you or even consider hiring a ghostwriter or transcriber  You cannot accomplish everything at once and deliver quality  Give yourself some time to recharge both your mind and body       Reevaluate your goals and priorities        I don’t even know where to begin    Here’s an exercise to get you started       Break down your obligations  duties  and tasks into two columns  In the first column  write all of those things people are depending on you to accomplish or what can only be done by you  In the second column  write down those things you do that could be done by someone else or reasonably eliminated altogether       Think of each item in your second column to be your  burnout relief  to do list by delegating these tasks or jettisoning them from your routine if they lack value       Next  write down your goals   personal  home  writing  and work goals that will create value in your life and work  Compare your goals to your first column  Is there anything that you can move over to the second column  Allow your goals to be the ruler that helps you measure your tasks and commitments   if it doesn’t measure up  delegate or eliminate it       For all commitments and tasks that remain in the first column  create a plan       Have a plan and rekindle your motivation        A goal is just a wish without a plan   Whatever type of plan you choose to implement   whether it targets your personal  professional  or writing goals   make sure it contains at least these three elements          It targets a specific goal          It’s broken into actionable steps          It’s rewarding   What I Do to Prevent Burnout  I’m S M A R T    that is  I plan S M A R T  goals by asking myself the following questions       Specific  What do I want to accomplish and what are its requirements or constraints      Measurable  What are the indicators I use to measure its success or achievement      Achievable  What are the steps I will take to accomplish this goal      Relevant  Is it worthwhile      Timely  What milestones should I meet or when will it be finally accomplished   Another strategy I’m a huge fan of is the to do list   daily lists  project lists  writing lists  shopping lists

2014-07-05 17:32:30 INFO  WordsCounter:28 - Text after ReGex The Metro  by Josef Essberger  The MetroThe discovery of a body in the Paris Metro early one morning was not particularly unusual  That it was headless sent a frisson through the sixth arrondissement  but the incident went unnoticed outside Paris   Yet there was clearly something strange about the case  It was hardly as though the body had been decapitated to frustrate identification  for it was fully clothed and none of the owner s personal effects had been removed  save of course for his head  The Paris police soon tied up the contents of the dead man s wallet with forensic evidence from the body  Added to that  Madame Charente  the dead man s wife  could positively identify the body in the most intimate ways   She had already reported her husband as missing    A few men were despatched to poke around in the warm  dark tunnels on either side of Od on station  where the body had been found  Above ground another search was made  equally fruitlessly  and to Inspector Dutruelle it looked as though the case would linger on unsolved   Two weeks later  four kilometres away in the west  a headless body was found at Courcelles station  again in the tunnel not far from the platform  As in the earlier case  the cause of death was apparently the severing of the head  which appeared to have been done with some precision  Again  the body was fully clothed and easily identified  and nothing but the head had apparently been removed    What can I tell these blessed reporters   Inspector Dutruelle said as he handed his wife the two sticks of bread he usually bought on the way home   They want answers for everything  And it s not just the papers now  the politicians are getting worried too  I m reporting to the Pr fet on this one     If there were instant answers for everything  mon petit chou  they d have no need of you   said Madame Dutruelle   And where would they be without you  Who cleared up that terrible Clichy case last year  and the acid bath at Reuilly Diderot    The little inspecteur divisionnaire chef pulled in his stomach  puffed out his chest and rose to his full height  A smile spread across his round face  In his smart dark suit and gold rimmed glasses you could have taken him for a provincial bank manager rather than one of Paris s most successful policemen    Just think   he said wryly   they were actually about to close the file on Dr Gomes before I took charge of the investigation     They re fools  all of them     All the same  my dear  I don t know where to go on this one  There re no leads  There s no apparent motive  And it s a bizarre pattern  Assuming  of course  it is a pattern  We can t be sure of that until there s been another    Inspector Dutruelle did not have long to wait for his pattern to emerge  A telephone call at half past five the next morning dragged him from his bed    It s another one  sir   said the voice at the other end    Another what     It s identical  Another headless corpse  just like the others   male  middle aged  white     Where   asked Inspector Dutruelle fumbling for a cigarette    Ch teau Rouge     In the Metro     Yes sir  just inside the tunnel  In the anti suicide well between the tracks     Close the line   if you haven t already  I ll be with you soon  And don t move it  d you hear    Inspector Dutruelle replaced the receiver with a sigh as his wife padded into the room    I hate these early morning cases   he muttered  He lit his cigarette    Have a coffee before you go  Another dead body will keep     But we ve closed the line  And it s the other side of town  my dear  North Paris     All the same    He sat down heavily and watched his wife sullenly as she made the coffee  Madame Dutruelle was a simple woman of forty six whose long  thin lipped face was framed by stern grey hair  Her strong  practical hands were country hands  and she had never got used to city life  She lived for the day when she and her husband would retire to their home village in Les Pyren es  Inspector Dutruelle sighed to himself again  Poor Agnes  She tried so hard to please him  How could she know that he longed to be free of her  How could she possibly know of Vololona  the young Malagasy he had met while on the Clichy case  For him it had been love at first sight    And for me too  my darling   Vololona had been quick to agree  her large brown eyes welling with tears as they gazed at him through the smoke of the Chatte et Lapin where she worked   a veritable coup de foudre   She spoke French well  with a Malagasy accent and huskiness that left you with a sense of mystery and promise  Inspector Dutruelle was a happy man  but he was careful to tell no one except Monsieur Ch baut  his closest friend  about the source of his happiness    I ve never felt like this before  Pierre  I m captivated by her   he said one evening when he took Monsieur Ch baut to see Vololona dancing   It was a rare experience  even for the jaded Monsieur Ch baut  In the frantic coloured spotlights of the Chatte et Lapin Vololona danced solo and in her vitality you sensed the wildness of Madagascar  Her black limbs lashed the air to the music  which was raw and sensual    You know  Pierre  in thirty years of marriage I was never unfaithful  Well  you know that already  There was always my work  and the children  and I was happy enough at home  It never occured to me to look at another woman  But something happened when I met Vololona  She showed me how to live  She showed me what real ecstasy is  Look at her  Pierre  Isn t she the most exquisite thing you ever saw  And she adores me  She s crazy about me  But why  I ask you  What can she see in me   three times her age  pot bellied  bald       married    Inspector Dutruelle leaned back in his chair and swung around to look at the other customers applauding Vololona from the shadows  He smiled proudly to himself  He knew exactly what was on their minds  Life was strange  he thought  and you could never tell  Some of them were young men  tall and handsome and virile  yet none of them knew Vololona as he knew her   Monsieur Ch baut finished his whisky    I can see   he said   that a man in your position might have certain attractions for an immigrant without papers working in one of the more dangerous quarters of Paris   Monsieur Ch baut was a lawyer    You re a cynic  Pierre     And after thirty years in the force you re not     Personally  I believe her when she says she loves me  I just don t know why  Another whisky     Well  one thing s for sure  R gis  it can t go on like that  One way or another things ll come to a head  But I must agree  she s exquisite all right  Like an exquisite Venus fly trap  And at the germane moment  you know  those soft  succulent petals will close around you like a vice    The normally placid Inspector was piqued by his friend s unreasonable attitude    How can you say that   he snapped   When you haven t even spoken to her     But all women are the same  R gis  Don t you know that  You should be a lawyer  then you d know it  They can t help it  they re built that way  Believe me  it can t go on without something happening    Inspector Dutruelle glowered at his old schoolfriend and said nothing  Monsieur Ch baut could see he had touched a raw nerve  He grinned amicably and leaned across to slap his friend playfully on the shoulder    Look R gis  all I m saying is  be careful  you haven t got my experience    Of course  that was true  When it came to women few men had Monsieur Ch baut s experience  Or his luck  for that matter  He was one of those people who go through life insulated from difficulties  He crossed roads without looking  He did not hurry for trains  He never reconciled bank accounts  Tall  slim  with boyish good looks and thick  black  wavy hair  he was the antithesis of Inspector Dutruelle    Look  you ve got two women involved  R gis   Monsieur Ch baut continued   and women aren t like us  Agnes isn t stupid  She must know something s going on     She hasn t said anything   said the Inspector brusquely  He lit another Gauloise    Of course she hasn t  She s cleverer than you are  She intends to keep you     Mind you   said Inspector Dutruelle grudgingly   she has had some odd dreams recently   so she says  About me and another woman  But anyway  she just laughs and says she can t believe it     But R gis  you must know that what we say and what we think are seldom the same     Sometimes I wonder if I ought to tell her something  if only out of decency    Monsieur Ch baut nearly choked on the fresh whisky he had just put to his lips    No   he cried with a passion that surprised the Inspector   never  you must never tell her   coute R gis  even if she did mention it  you must deny everything  Even if she caught the two of you in the act  you must deny it  You can only tell a woman there s another when you ve definitively made up your mind to leave her  and even then it may not be safe     So much for logic     It s no use looking for logic in women  R gis  I told you  they re not like men  In fact  I ve come to the conclusion that they re not even the same species as men  Men and women aren t like dog and bitch  they re more like dog and cat  C est bizarre  non  In any case  I do know you can t keep two women on the go without something happening  I don t know what  but something    Now the European press had picked the story up and the little Inspector did not know how to deal with the international reporters who hung around like flies outside the old stone walls of the Pr fecture de police  Their stories focussed on the bizarre nature of the killings  and the idea that there were three severed heads somewhere in Paris particularly excited them  They wanted constantly to know more  So of course did Inspector Dutruelle    I assure you  gentlemen   he told a press conference   we are at least as anxious as you to recover the missing parts  We are doing everything possible  You can tell your readers that wherever they are  we ll find them     Can we have photographs of the victims for our readers   asked one of the foreign reporters    So as we know which heads we re looking for   added a journalist from London   It was a joke that was not shared by the people of Paris  Suddenly the normally carnival atmosphere of the Metro had evaporated  Buskers no longer worked the coaches between stations  Puppeteers and jugglers no longer entertained passengers with impromptu performances  Even the beggars  who habitually hung around the crowded stations or made impassioned speeches in the carriages  had gone  And the few passengers who remained sat more long faced than ever  or walked more hastily down the long corridors between platforms   Inspector Dutruelle despaired of ever clearing the case up  His mind  already excited over Vololona  was now in a turmoil  Vololona had suddenly  and tearfully  announced that she was pregnant  Then  having accepted his financial assistance to terminate the pregnancy   but refusing his offer to take her to the clinic   she told him one day on the telephone   I thought you were going to ask me to marry you   Inspector Dutruelle was stunned    But you know I m married  ma ch rie   he said    I thought you d leave Agnes   she replied   I wanted to be with you  I wanted to share everything with you       my child       my life       my bed   Inspector Dutruelle could hear her sobbing    But darling  we can still see each other     No  it s too painful  I love you too much    Inspector Dutruelle could not concentrate on his work at all  Day and night his thoughts were on Vololona  he longed to be with her  If only Agnes would leave him  And if only Vololona would be satisfied with what he gave her already   the dinners  the presents  the apartment  Why did women have to possess you  It seemed that the more you gave them the more they took  until there was nothing left to give but yourself  Perhaps Pierre was right after all  when you thought about it   The investigation into the Metro murders was proceeding dismally  Inspector Dutruelle had no suspect  no leads  no motive  His superiors complained about his lack of progress and the press ridiculed him without pity   It appears   commented France Soir   that the only thing Inspector Dutruelle can tell us with certainty is that with each fresh atrocity the Metro station name grows longer   The detectives under him could not understand what had happened to their normally astute Inspector  and they felt leaderless and demoralised  It was left to the security police of the Metro to point out one rather obvious fact  that the three stations where bodies had been found had one thing in common   their lines intersected at Metro Barbes Rochechouart  and it seemed that something might be learned by taking the Metro between them   Inspector Dutruelle did not like public transport  and he especially did not like the Metro  It was cramped  smelly and claustrophobic at the best of times  and in the summer it was hot  You stood on the very edge of the platform just to feel the breeze as the blue and white trains pulled into the station  It was years since the Inspector had used the Metro    I can t take much more of this  Marc  he said to the young Detective Constable who was travelling with him   it s too hot  We ll get off at the next stop     That s Barbes Rochechouart  sir  We can change there     No  Marc  We can get out there  Someone else can take a sauna  I ve had enough  Anyway  we need to have a look around   Inspector Dutruelle wiped his brow  He sounded irritable   God knows what it s like normally   he added   When the train pulled in they took the exit for Boulevard de Rochechouart    At least we can get through now   said the Detective Constable as they walked up the passage towards the escalator    How d you mean   asked Inspector Dutruelle    Well  normally this station s packed   beggars  passengers  buskers  hawkers  plus all their tables and stalls  It s like a damn great fair and market rolled into one  You can get anything here  from Eiffel Towers to cabbages and potatoes   not to mention a spot of cannabis or heroin     Oh  yes   said Inspector Dutruelle  vaguely   I remember   He passed a handkerchief across his brow again   At the turnstyles a man was handing out publicity cards and he thrust one into Inspector Dutruelle s hand  Glancing down at it and squinting in the bright sunlight  the Inspector read aloud    Professor Dhiakobli  Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life          He broke off in mid sentence with a snort    What a lot of mumbo jumbo  Headless chickens and voodoo magic     It may be mumbo jumbo to you  sir   said the Detective Constable with a laugh   but round here they take that sort of thing seriously  And not only round here   after all  we use some of these techniques in the police  don t we     Oh really  Such as     Well  graphology for a start   you can hardly call basing a murder case on the size of someone s handwriting scientific  can you sir  Or what about astrology   employing people on the basis of the stars  Or numerology     Yes  Marc   said Inspector Dutruelle  pushing the card into his top pocket   maybe you re right  and maybe when you re older you won t be so sure  Now get on the blower and call the car    The hot July turned to hotter and more humid August  No more bodies were found in the sweltering tunnels of the Metro  and the media  bored with the lack of developments  left Inspector Dutruelle to his original obscurity  Paris  deserted by its citizens in the yearly exodus to the coast  was tolerable only to the tourists with backpacks who flocked to the cheap hotels and began again to crowd the Metro  Then  in September  the Parisiens came back and life returned to normal   But Inspector Dutruelle s passion for Vololona did not cool with the season  Vololona had at last agreed to see him  occasionally  but she always managed  with tears in her eyes  to deflect his more amorous advances  For Inspector Dutruelle it was beneath him to observe that he continued to pay the rent on her apartment  but he was growing increasingly frustrated  The notion that she had another lover obsessed him  and in the evenings he took to prowling the broad Boulevard de Clichy between her apartment and the Chatte et Lapin  Sometimes he would stand for hours watching her door  as locals strolled past with their dogs or sat on the benches under the plane trees  Now  denied the one thing here he wanted  the scene filled him with dismay  Money and music were in the air  Lovers sipped coffee in the open and watched the whores in their doorways  Pigeons fluttered as girls in tight mini skirts hurried to work  Tourists with their Deutschmarks arrived by the busload and the touts in dark glasses worked hard to coax them into the expensive sex shows and neon lit video clubs  Somewhere deep below ran the Metro  but Inspector Dutruelle had no more interest in that  His superiors had given up hope of solving the Metro murders and had moved him on to other things  Sometimes he would stay all night  leaving to the tinkle of broken glass as workmen swept up after the night s revelries  Occasionally he would see Vololona leave her apartment to buy cigarettes  but he never once saw her on the arm of another man  or saw a male visitor take the lift to the seventh floor   One night  late in October  he returned from the Boulevard de Clichy just after midnight  Madame Dutruelle  having been told that her husband was working on a case  and perhaps believing it  was already asleep  Had she been awake she would surely have been surprised to see him throw his jacket over a chair  for Inspector Dutruelle had always been meticulous with his clothes  the sort of man who irons his shoelaces  But the jacket missed and dropped to the floor  Muttering to himself  the Inspector bent and picked it up  and as he did so something fell from the top pocket  He gazed at it blankly for a moment  Then he realised it was the card he had been given at the metro station  a little the worse for having been once or twice to the cleaners  but still legible  He picked it up and slowly started to read   PROFESSOR DHIAKOBLI Grand M dium Voyant can help you succeed rapidly in all areas of life  luck  love  marriage  attraction of clients  examinations  sexual potency  If you desire to make another love you or if your loved one has left with another  this is his domain  you will be loved and your partner will return  Prof  Dhiakobli will come behind you like a dog  He will create between you a perfect rapport on the basis of love  All problems resolved  even desperate cases  Every day from  am to  pm  Payment after results    b  rue Beldamme        Paris staircase B   th floor  door on left Metro  Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle stood in his socks and braces reading the card over and over again   All problems resolved        It was preposterous  And yet  it was tempting  What harm could there be in a little hocus pocus when everything else had failed  After all  everyone knew that even the police used clairvoyants when they were really up against it   Rue Beldamme was a backstreet of tenement buildings in Paris s eighteenth arrondissement  an area popular with immigrants from francophone Africa  It lay close to the busy crossroads straddled by Metro Barbes Rochechouart  Inspector Dutruelle parked in the next street and walked the rest of the way  cursing because he had not brought his umbrella  The door to number   b was swinging in the wind  its dark paint peeling badly  He stepped through into a narrow courtyard and found his way to the sixth floor door on which a brass plaque read   Professor Dhiakobli Sp cialiste des travaux occultes Please ring   He stood there  breathing heavily from the stairs  and before he could press the bell the door opened and a man appeared    Please enter  my dear sir   said the man with an elegant wave of the hand and exaggerated courtesy   I am Dhiakobli  And I have the honour to meet           As Inspector Dutruelle had imagined  Professor Dhiakobli was black  He had a short yet commanding figure  and was dressed in a well tailored grey suit  A large  silk handkerchief fell from his top pocket    For the moment   said Inspector Dutruelle   my name is hardly important  I ve only come in response to your advertisement     Monsieur has perhaps some small problem with which I can help  A minor indiscretion  Please be seated  sir  and let us talk about the matter    Inspector Dutruelle handed his coat and gloves to the Professor and sat in the large  well upholstered chair to which he had been directed  Professor Dhiakobli himself settled behind a large mahogany desk  on top of which a chihuahua hardly bigger than a mouse was lounging  its wide  moist eyes gazing disdainfully at the newcomer    Ah  I see that Zeus approves of you   said the Professor  stroking the tiny dog with the tips of his manicured fingers  his own unblinking eyes also fixed on Inspector Dutruelle   Poor Zeus  mon petit papillon  he is devoted to me  but he must remain here whenever I leave France  And you are fortunate  monsieur  It is only now that I return from C te d Ivoire  It is my country you know  I return there for a few months each summer  Paris in summer is so disagreeable  don t you agree    Professor Dhiakobli glittered with success  The frames of his glasses  the heavy bracelet on his right wrist and the watch on his left  the gem studded rings on his fingers   all were of gold  From his manner and cultured French accent it was evident that he was an educated man  Around him the large room was like a shrine  Heavy curtains excluded the daylight  the only illumination was a small brass desklamp  and the dark  red walls were festooned with spears  costumes  photographs and other African memorabilia  There was a sweet smell in the air  and in one corner of the room the feathers of a ceremonial African headgear lay draped inappropriately over an enormous American refrigerator  You could not help being struck by the incongruity of this bizarre scene in the roughest quarter of Paris    As I say   began Inspector Dutruelle  ignoring the Professor s question   I saw your card and I wondered just how you work     And may one enquire as to monsieur s little difficulty    Inspector Dutruelle cleared his throat and tried to adopt as nonchalant an air as he could    Well     he coughed again    first of all  I wondered what sort of things you can help people with    The Professor s eyebrows rose    Anything   he said slowly  his smile revealing a set of large white teeth that shone brilliantly in the dimness against his black skin   My dear sir  anything at all     And then  I wondered  how do you operate  That s to say  what exactly do you do       and how do you charge     Ah monsieur  let us not talk of money  First I must learn just how I can help you  And for that a consultation is in order    Inspector Dutruelle shifted in his seat    And what would a consultation involve  What does it       cost    Professor Dhiakobli wrung his hands and shrugged amicably    Mon cher monsieur  I do understand how distasteful it is to you to discuss so vulgar a matter as money  I too recoil at the mere thought of it  It has been my mission in life to help those who have suffered misfortune  And if some donate a small token of their gratitude  who am I to refuse their offering  They pay according to their means  to assist those who have little to offer  But for a preliminary consultation  monsieur  a nominal sum  as a mark of good faith  is usually in order  For a gentleman of your obvious standing  a trifle  a mere two hundred francs  And let me assure you  monsieur  of my absolute discretion  Nothing you may choose to tell me will go beyond these walls   He paused  Then he threw out his hands and added with a grin   They have the sanctity of the confessional     I m glad to hear it   said the Inspector    But monsieur still has the advantage of me        continued Professor Dhiakobli   Inspector Dutruelle decided that he had nothing to lose by talking  He adopted the name of Monsieur Mazodier  a Parisien wine merchant  and began to tell the Professor of the dilemma that was tearing at his soul  He told him of the young Malagasy girl he had met while entertaining clients  of their instant and passionate love for one another  of her sudden irrational refusal any longer to give herself to him  and of the wife he now knew he should never have married but whom he had not the heart to leave  Monsieur Mazodier was at his wits  end and now even his business was suffering  He feared that if he did not find a resolution to his problem he might do something that he or others would regret  The Professor listened intently  asking appropriate questions at appropriate moments  Finally Inspector Dutruelle said   Well  Professor Dhiakobli  I think that s all I can tell you  I don t think I can tell you any more  From what I have told you  do you believe you can help me    For a long time there was silence  The Professor appeared to be in another world  He stared at Inspector Dutruelle  but seemed to be looking through him    My dear Monsieur Mazodier   he said at last  very slowly  almost mechanically   the story you have told me is most poignant  Each of us has a hidden corner in his life  a jardin secret  Yet it is rare indeed for men to come to me with problems such as yours  Perhaps it is natural that most of my lovelorn clients should be women  At the mercy of their complex physical structure  is it any wonder that women are such emotional creatures  I help them find their lost ones  their partners of many years  to recreate again the rapport of their youth  You will understand that it is not easy  But this is my work  My domain     So you can t help me   said Inspector Dutruelle  adding despondently   Perhaps what I really need is a head shrink    The Professor gave a start  Again  for a long time he did not answer  Then his teeth flashed in the dimness     coutez monsieur  this is my work  my domain   he repeated   Certainly I can help you  But you must understand that it will not be easy  It calls for a special ceremony  In the first place  you are married  and I shall be required to work my influence on not one but two women  In the second  we are both men of the world  monsieur  and you will not be offended if I remark upon the extreme disparity in your ages  And finally  it is clear to me that this young girl has chained your heart with her magic  You know  the magic of Madagascar is very strong  No  monsieur  it will not be easy  Enduring love cannot be bought with money alone  Sometimes        He hesitated and looked Inspector Dutruelle straight in the eye  his own eyes suddenly cold and vacant   Sometimes   he said   we must make sacrifices     What sort of sacrifices   asked Inspector Dutruelle dully    Oh  my dear sir  you must leave that to me  But one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs   His cold eyes remained fixed on the Inspector and he spoke in a monotone without pausing for breath   You must not concern yourself with technicalities  monsieur  Your mind must be fixed on the future  on the life you have dreamed of  You must envisage your wife   happy in the arms of another  You must picture the fragile young child you so yearn for       secure in your arms       sharing your life       your days       your nights  The perfect solution to all your problems  Is it not worth a considerable sum     It certainly would be worth a lot        Inspector Dutruelle muttered as the Professor s words came to life in his mind    Shall we say thirty thousand francs     I m sorry   muttered the Inspector    Let s say fifteen thousand before and fifteen afterwards   the Professor went on as though his visitor had not spoken   Do you see  monsieur  how confident I am of success    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was confused  He had not expected the Professor to be so blunt  or to propose quite so generous a token  But it did not seem to matter  After all  what was thirty thousand francs to achieve what he craved so desperately  And  in any case  at worst it was only fifteen thousand   The Professor s eyes were still fixed on Inspector Dutruelle    Of course  monsieur  I have faith in your gratitude  I know that you will not forget  in your delight  that what I have done  I can undo  And now  monsieur  you must not allow me to detain you further  We have much work to do  In eight days you will return with photographs and details of Madame Mazodier and the Malagasy  And with some little articles of clothing  something close to their thoughts  say a scarf or a hat  You can arrange this    Inspector Dutruelle nodded blankly    Excellent  monsieur  I must know them in every detail   if I am to have a spiritual t te   t te with each of them  So  in fifteen days  you will return for the ceremony  It will take place beyond those curtains  in the space reserved for the ancestral spirits  Nobody but I and my assistants may enter there  but nevertheless it is imperative that you be present on the day  It must be at dawn  and you must come without fail   the ceremony cannot be deferred  Can you manage six in the morning  shall we say Monday the sixteenth    Inspector Dutruelle did not sleep well on the night of the fifteenth of December  At four o clock in the morning he got out of bed  Though his wife stirred she did not wake  He showered and dressed  His nerves were on edge as he fiddled around in the kitchen  boiling water for his coffee  He drank two cups  strong and black  but he looked helplessly at the croissants he had spread clumsily with jam  He lit a Gauloise and paced the room  Then he pulled the windows open and leaned on the railing  finishing his cigarette  Below him the courtyard was dark and silent  and above him the sky was black  But away in the east  through the open end of the court  a violet hue was creeping over Paris  He glanced at his watch  It was a quarter past five and time to fetch the car  It would seem strange  leaving at that time of the morning without an official car and driver  He wondered what the concierge would make of it all   she was bound to be polishing the brasses by the time he reached the ground floor  He gave a shiver and pushed the windows shut   Then he put the keys of the Renault in his coat pocket and checked that he had everything  He looked into the bedroom  Gently  he drew the duvet back and looked at his wife as she slept  her arms clasped about her knees  He leaned over and touched his lips to her cheek  Then he closed the bedroom door silently behind him  switched the lights off in the living room and kitchen  and opened the front door  As he did so the telephone rang  It startled him and he cursed aloud  He closed the front door again and hurried to answer the phone so that his wife should not wake    Inspector Dutruelle   said the voice at the other end    Yes  what is it     Sorry to disturb you at this time of the morning  Monsieur l Inspecteur  It s the Pr fecture     Never mind the time   said Inspector Dutruelle with as much irritation as his whispering voice could convey   I m off duty today     Well  that s the point  Inspector  The Pr fet s ordered us to call you specially  He appreciates you re not on duty  but he wants you anyway     It s quite impossible     I m afraid he insists  sir     Why     He insists you come on duty immediately  sir  We re sending a car round for you     Yes  yes  I understand  but why     It s the Metro again  sir     The Metro     Yes  sir  They ve found another corpse on the line  decapitated again    Inspector Dutruelle did not reply  He was cursing to himself  He was cursing the Pr fet  the police  this homicidal maniac  his wife  Why today  Why ever today    Sir  Hello sir  The car ll be with you in five minutes     Yes  all right  I ll be ready in five minutes    The big black Citroen was soon speeding away from Rue Dauphine and heading north across Pont Neuf  Inspector Dutruelle looked at the winter mists rising from the Seine  His dreams  it seemed  were evaporating just as surely    You d better brief me on this as quick as you can   he said wearily to the Detective Sergeant he had found waiting for him in the car   Where was the body found     Barbes Rochechouart  sir    A cold shiver passed through the Inspector    I presume it s the same as the others   he asked    Well  in as much as there s nothing to go on  it s the same  sir  Otherwise it couldn t be more different  For a start  we ve just heard they ve found two of them now  And this time they re women  One white  in her forties  and one black  A young black girl   still in her teens  by the look of things    But Inspector Dutruelle was not listening  He was staring blankly through the glass to his right  and as they turned at Place du Ch telet the empty streets were no more than a cold  grey blur to him  The car swung onto the broad Boulevard de S bastopol and accelerated northwards to cover the three kilometres to Metro Barbes Rochechouart  It was the route he should have been taking in his own car   Outside the station  now closed to passengers  people were standing around under the street lights with their collars up  Inspector Dutruelle got out of the car  He hesitated  He glanced towards Rue Beldamme  just a stone s throw away across the bleak Boulevard de Rochechouart  where the Professor would be waiting for him  He shrugged and went down the station steps   Underground  on the number four line  there was an air of gloom  Both bodies lay where they had been spotted by the first train drivers through that morning  Inspector Dutruelle looked impassively at the first one  It was the body of a middle aged woman  quite unexceptional  coarse and wiry  like his wife    She s forty seven  Monsieur l Inspecteur   said somebody beside him   French  Name of Madame Catherine Dubur  Not like the other one     The other one   said the Inspector blankly    I told you in the car  sir   said the Detective Sergeant at his ear   there s two of them     You d better show me    They strolled in their overcoats to the other end of the platform and went down the little steps that led to the track  A uniformed policeman pulled back the blanket that covered the second body  which lay on its back  Inspector Dutruelle stared dispassionately at the stiff  black limbs that stuck out awkwardly across the railway lines  Suddenly he shuddered in alarm  Even in the dim lights of the train that was pulled up beyond you could see the resemblance to Vololona    Identity   he asked  He tried to control his voice    We don t know  sir   this is all we found   said a policeman  handing him a tattered greetings card  Inside  in large  green handwriting  were the words   Happy Nineteenth Birthday  from Everyone in Antananarivo     D you think she s Malagasy  sir   asked the policeman  The Inspector shrugged his shoulders  then held out an open hand    Your torch  please   he said   He played its beam over the body  up and down the long  slender legs  across the clothes  At least he did not recognise the clothes  Yet the body s size  its build  its colour  everything pointed to Vololona  He bent down and flashed the light onto the fingers of the left hand and laughed weakly to himself as he saw the tawdry rings that glinted back at him  He stood up in relief  That was certainly not Vololona  Yet it was uncanny how this body reminded him of her   and the other of Agnes  for that matter  Even the ages were the same   He smoked as he stood staring at the headless corpse  He could not understand  Was the magic of Madagascar really so strong that now he saw Vololona everywhere  And what of Agnes  How would Professor Dhiakobli explain that  How could he explain it  when you came to think of it  When you came to think of it  he had explained very little  He had been happy enough to take the money  and free enough with his words   all those grandiose notions of mission and sacrifice and spiritual t te   t tes        Inspector Dutruelle gasped    The devil   he muttered to himself  Suddenly he understood everything    The what  sir   said somebody beside him    Never mind   he answered quietly  putting his hand to his breast pocket  His heart had started to pound with a sense of danger and his head suddenly ached with questions  He took out his cigarette case and lit another Gauloise  Through its curling blue smoke  back lit by the lights of the train  the black limbs were splayed out in a grotesque dance  while beside him men s voices were thrumming in his ear  Why was there no time to think  to extricate himself from this nightmare  He cursed himself  How could he have been so stupid  He cursed his wife and Vololona  And Professor Dhiakobli  What madness had driven him to this  Then he cursed himself again  and turned abruptly to one of the men babbling at his side    What time is it     Six fifteen  sir    For a moment  he hesitated  Then he called for the Detective Sergeant who was with the photographer at the other body     coute Guy  when he s got his pictures they can move the bodies and fix things up   he said   Now get me the Pr fet    The Pr fet was beside himself with rage at this further disturbance to his sleep  and he exploded with indignation when Inspector Dutruelle offered his resignation    Are you insane  man  You re in the middle of an investigation     The investigation is over  Monsieur le Pr fet     So  you have the killer at last     In fifteen minutes  monsieur  in fifteen minutes     Then why in the name of God are you asking to be relieved from duty

his first pieces theMaple Leaf Rag  became ragtime s first and most influential hit and has been recognized as the archetypal rag[] Joplin was born into a musical family of laborers in Northeast Texas  and developed his musical knowledge with the help of local teachers most notablyJulius Weiss  Joplin grew up in Texarkana  where he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar During the late s he left his job as a laborer with the railroad and travelled around theAmerican South  as an itinerant musician He went to Chicago for theWorld s Fair  of  which played a major part in making

also brought the composer a steady income for life though Joplin did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problemsJoplin moved to St Louis  in  where he continued to compose and publish music and regularly performed in the St Louis community By the time he had moved to St Louis he may have been experiencing discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearly as a result of having contractedsyphilis  The score to his first opera A Guest of Honor  was confiscated in  with his belongings owing to his nonpayment of bills and is considered

in late  or early  Although for many years his birth date was accepted as November   research has revealed that this is almost certainly inaccurate the most likely approximate date being the second half of []  He was the second of six children the others being Monroe Robert William Myrtle and Ossie[]  born to Giles Joplin an exslave from North Carolina  and Florence Givens a freeborn AfricanAmerican woman fromKentucky [] [] []  The Joplins subsequently moved to Texarkana where Giles worked as a laborer for the railroad while Florence was a cleaner Joplin s father had played theviolin  for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo []  Joplin was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned[] At some point in the early s Giles Joplin left the family for another woman leaving Florence to provide for her children through domestic work Biographer Susan Curtis speculated that his mother s support of Joplin s musical education was an important causal factor in this separation His father argued that it took the boy away from practical employment that would supplement the family income[] According to a family friend the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing the piano after school While a few local teachers aided him he received most of his music education fromJulius Weiss  a GermanJewish  music professor who had immigrated to the United States from Germany[]  Weiss had studied music at university in Germany and was listed in town records as aProfessor of music Impressed by Joplin s talent and realizing his family s dire straits Weiss taught him free of charge He tutored the yearold Joplin until he was  during which time Weiss introduced him tofolk  and classical music including opera Weiss helped Joplin appreciate music as an art as well as an entertainment[]  and helped his mother acquire a used piano According to his wife Lottie Joplin never forgot Weiss and in his later years when he achieved fame as a composer sent his former teacher gifts of money when he was old and ill until Weiss died[]  At the age of  Joplin performed in a vocal quartet with three other boys in and around Texarkana playing piano In addition he taught guitar and mandolin[] Life in the Southern states and Chicago[edit ]In the late s having performed at various local events as a teenager Joplin chose to give up work as a laborer with the railroad and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician[]  Little is known about his movements at this time although he is recorded in Texarkana in July  as a member of theTexarkana Minstrels in a performance that happened to be raising money for a monument toJefferson Davis  President of the Southern Confederacy[]  He soon discovered however that there were few opportunities for black pianists Churches andbrothels  were among the few options for steady work Joplin played preragtime  jigpiano  in variousredlight districts  throughout the midSouth and some claim he was in Sedalia and St Louis during this time[] [] In  Joplin was in Chicago for the World s Fair  While in Chicago he formed his first band playingcornet  and began arranging music for the group to perform Although the World s Fair minimized the involvement of AfricanAmericans black performers still came to the saloons cafs and brothels that lined the fair The exposition was attended by  million Americans and had a profound effect on many areas of American cultural life including ragtime Although specific information is sparse numerous sources have credited the Chicago World Fair with spreading the popularity of ragtime[]  Joplin found that his music as well as that of other black performers was popular with visitors[]  By  ragtime had become a national craze in American cities and was described by theSt Louis Dispatch as a veritable call of the wild which mightily stirred the pulses of city bred people[] Life in Missouri[edit ]A  recording of the Maple Leaf Rag by the United States Marine Band This is the first surviving recording of theMaple Leaf Rag  []  []

At first Joplin stayed with the family ofArthur Marshall  at the time a year old boy but later one of Joplin s students and a ragtime composer in his own right[]  There is no record of Joplin having a permanent residence in the town until  as Joplin was making a living as a touring musician     Front cover of the third edition of the Maple Leaf Rag sheet music There is little precise evidence known about Joplin s activities at this time although he performed as a solo musician at dances and at the major black clubs in Sedalia theBlack  club and the Maple Leaf Club He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own sixpiece dance orchestra A tour with his own singing group the Texas Medley Quartet gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions and it is known that he went toSyracuse New York  and Texas Two businessmen from New York published Joplin s first two works the songsPlease Say You Will and A Picture of her Face in []  Joplin s visit toTemple Texas  enabled him to have three pieces published there in  including theGreat Crush Collision March  which commemorated aplanned train crash  on the MissouriKansasTexas Railroad  on September  that he may have witnessed The March was described by one of Joplin s biographers as a special early essay in ragtime[]  While in Sedalia he was teaching piano to students who included future ragtime composersArthur Marshall  Brun Campbell  and Scott Hayden []  In turn Joplin enrolled at theGeorge R Smith College  where he apparently studied advanced harmony and composition The College records were destroyed in a fire in []  and biographer Edward A Berlin notes that it was unlikely that a small college for AfricanAmericans would be able to provide such a course[] [] [] In  Joplin married Belle the sisterinlaw of collaborator Scott Hayden  Although there were hundreds of rags in print by the time the Maple Leaf Rag was published Joplin was not far behind His first published ragOriginal Rags  had been completed in  the same year as the first ragtime work in print theMississippi Rag by William Krell  The Maple Leaf Rag was likely to have been known in Sedalia before its publication in  Brun Campbell claimed to have seen the manuscript of the work in around []  The exact circumstances that led to the Maple Leaf Rag s publication are unknown and a number of versions of the event contradict each other After several unsuccessful approaches to publishers Joplin signed a contract on August   withJohn Stillwell Stark  a retailer of musical instruments who later became his most important publisher The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a  royalty on all sales of the rag with a minimum sales price of  cents[]  With the inscription To the Maple Leaf Club prominently visible along the top of at least some editions it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club although there is no direct evidence to prove the link and there were many other possible sources for the name in and around Sedalia at the time[]     Scott Joplin House  in St Louis Missouri  There have been many claims about the sales of theMaple Leaf Rag for example that Joplin was the first musician to sell  million copies of a piece of instrumental music[]  Joplin s first biographerRudi Blesh  wrote that during its first six months the piece sold  copies and became the first great instrumental sheet music hit in America[]  However research by Joplin s later biographer Edward A Berlin demonstrated that this was not the case the initial printrun of  took one year to sell and under the terms of Joplin s contract with a  royalty would have given Joplin an income of  or approximately at current prices Later sales were steady and would have given Joplin an income that would have covered his expenses In  estimated sales would have given him an income of  annually approximately in current prices[] The Maple Leaf Rag did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers especially in the development of classic ragtime[]  After the publication of theMaple Leaf Rag Joplin was soon being described as King of rag time writers not least by himself[]  on the covers of his own work such asThe Easy Winners  and Elite Syncopations After the Joplins moved to St Louis  in early  they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth Joplin s relationship with his wife was difficult as she had no interest in music They eventually separated and then divorced[]  About this time Joplin collaborated with Scott Hayden in the composition of four rags[]  It was in St Louis that Joplin produced some of his bestknown works includingThe Entertainer  March Majestic and the short theatrical work The Ragtime Dance In June  Joplin married Freddie Alexander of Little Rock Arkansas  the young woman to whom he had dedicatedThe Chrysanthemum She died on September   of complications resulting from a cold ten weeks after their wedding[]  Joplin s first work copyrighted after Freddie s death Bethena  was described by one biographer as an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of ragtimewaltzes [] During this time Joplin created an opera company of  people and produced his first operaA Guest of Honor  for a national tour It is not certain how many productions were staged or even if this was an allblack show or a racially mixed production During the tour either inSpringfield Illinois  orPittsburg Kansas  someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts Joplin could not meet the company s payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house It is believed that the score forA Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of nonpayment of the company s boarding house bill[] Later years[edit ]     Front cover of the Wall Street Rag  sheet music In  Joplin moved to New York City which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera After his move to New York Joplin met Lottie Stokes whom he married in []  In  unable to find a publisher Joplin undertook the financial burden of publishingTreemonisha  himself in pianovocal format In  as a lastditch effort to see it performed he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall inHarlem  Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment it was a miserable failure to a public not ready for crude black musical formsso different from the European grand opera of that time[]  The audience including potential backers was indifferent and walked out[]  Scott writes that after a disastrous single performance  Joplin suffered a breakdown He was bankrupt discouraged and worn out He concludes that few American artists of his generation faced such obstacles Treemonisha went unnoticed and unreviewed largely because Joplin had abandoned commercial music in favor of art music a field closed to African Americans[]  In fact it was not until the s that the opera received a full theatrical stagingIn  Joplin and Lottie selfpublished his Magnetic Rag  as the Scott Joplin Music Company which he had formed the previous December[]  Biographer Vera Brodsky Lawrence speculates that Joplin was aware of his advancing deterioration due tosyphilis  and was consciously racing against time In her sleeve notes on the Deutsche Grammophon  release of Treemonisha  she notes that he plunged feverishly into the task of orchestrating his opera day and night with his friend Sam Patterson standing by to copy out the parts page by page as each page of the full score was completed[] Death[edit ]By  Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilis  and a resulting descent into insanity[] []  In January  he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital  a mental institution[]  He died there on April  of syphilitic dementia at the age of [] []  and was buried in a pauper s grave that remained unmarked for  years His grave at Saint Michaels Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in []

music and Joplin s natural ability has been cited as contributing significantly to the invention of a new style that blended AfricanAmerican musical styles with European forms and melodies and first became celebrated in the sragtime [] When Joplin was learning the piano serious musical circles condemned ragtime because of its association with the vulgar and inane songs cranked out by the tunesmiths ofTin Pan Alley []  As a composer Joplin refined ragtime elevating it above the low and unrefined form played by the wandering honkytonk pianists playing mere dance music of popular imagination[]  This new art form the classic rag  combined AfroAmerican folk music ssyncopation  and thcentury European romanticism  with its harmonic schemes and its marchlike tempos[] []  In the words of one critic Ragtime was basically an AfroAmerican version of the polka or its analog theSousa style march[]  With this as a foundation Joplin intended his compositions to be played exactly as he wrote them without improvisation[]  Joplin wrote his rags as classical music in miniature form in order to raise ragtime above its cheap bordello origins and produced work that opera historian Elise Kirk described as  more tuneful contrapuntal infectious and harmonically colorful than any others of his era[] Some speculate that Joplin s achievements were influenced by his classically trained German music teacherJulius Weiss  who may have brought a polka  rhythmic sensibility from the old country to the year old Joplin[]  As Curtis put it The educated German could open up the door to a world of learning and music of which young Joplin was largely unaware[] Joplin s first and most significant hit the Maple Leaf Rag was described as the archetype of the classic rag and influenced subsequent rag composers for at least  years after its initial publication thanks to its rhythmic patterns melody lines and harmony[]  though with the exception of Joseph Lamb  they generally failed to enlarge upon it[] Treemonisha[edit ]    Treemonisha    Main article Treemonisha  The opera s setting is a former slave community in an isolated forest near Joplin s childhood town Texarkana in September  The plot centers on an year old woman Treemonisha who is taught to read by a white woman and then leads her community against the influence of conjurers who prey on ignorance and superstition Treemonisha is abducted and is about to be thrown into a wasps  nest when her friend Remus rescues her The community realizes the value of education and the liability of their ignorance before choosing her as their teacher and leader[] [] [] Joplin wrote both the score and the libretto for the opera which largely follows the form of European opera with many conventional arias ensembles and choruses In addition the themes of superstition and mysticism evident inTreemonisha are common in the operatic tradition and certain aspects of the plot echo devices in the work of the German composerRichard Wagner  of which Joplin was aware A sacred tree Treemonisha sits beneath recalls the tree that Siegmund takes his enchanted sword from inDie Walkre  and the retelling of the heroine s origins echos aspects of the operaSiegfried  In addition AfricanAmerican folk tales also influence the storythe wasp nest incident is similar to the story ofBr er Rabbit  and the briar patch[] Treemonisha is not a ragtime operabecause Joplin employed the styles of ragtime and other black music sparingly using them to convey racial character and to celebrate the music of his childhood at the end of the th century The opera has been seen as a valuable record of rural black music from late th century recreated by a skilled and sensitive participant[] Berlin speculates about parallels between the plot and Joplin s own life He notes that Lottie Joplin the composer s third wife saw a connection between the character Treemonisha s wish to lead her people out of ignorance and a similar desire in the composer In addition it has been speculated that Treemonisha represents Freddie Joplin s second wife because the date of the opera s setting was likely to have been the month of her birth[] At the time of the opera s publication in  the American Musician and Art Journal praised it as an entirely new form of operatic art[]  Later critics have also praised the opera as occupying a special place in American history with its heroine a startlingly early voice for modern civil rights causes notably the importance of education and knowledge to African American advancement[]  Curtis s conclusion is similar In the end Treemonisha offered a celebration of literacy learning hard work and community solidarity as the best formula for advancing the race[]  Berlin describes it as a fine opera certainly more interesting than most operas then being written in the United States but later states that Joplin s own libretto showed the composer was not a competent dramatist with the book not up to the quality of the music[] Performance skills[edit ]Pleasant Moments Ragtime Waltz played by Scott Joplin April   Sorry your browser either has JavaScript disabled or

Sedalia  newspaper in  and fellow ragtime composersArthur Marshall  and Joe Jordan  both said that he played the instrument well[]  However the son of publisher John Stark stated that Joplin was a rather mediocre pianist and that he composed on paper rather than at the pianoArtie Matthews  recalled the delight the St Louis players took in outplaying Joplin[] While Joplin never made an audio recording his playing is preserved on seven piano rolls  for use in mechanical player pianos  All seven were made in  Of these the six released under the Connorized label show evidence of significant editing[]  probably by William Axtmann the staff arranger at Connorized[]  Berlin theorizes that by the time Joplin reached St Louis he may have experienced discoordination of the fingers tremors and an inability to speak clearlyall symptoms of thesyphilis  that took his life in []  Biographer Blesh described the second roll recording of Maple Leaf Rag on the UniRecord label from June  as shocking disorganized and completely distressing to hear[]  While there is disagreement among pianoroll experts about the accuracy of the reproduction of a player s performance[] [] [] []  Berlin notes that the Maple Leaf Rag roll was painfully bad and likely to be the truest record of Joplin s playing at the time The roll however does not reflect his abilities earlier in life[] Legacy[edit ]     Nonpareil  Joplin and his fellow ragtime composers rejuvenated American popular music fostering an appreciation for African American music among European Americans by creating exhilarating and liberating dance tunes changing American musical taste Its syncopation and rhythmic drive gave it a vitality and freshness attractive to young urban audiences indifferent to Victorian proprieties  Joplin s ragtime expressed the intensity and energy of a modern urban America[] Joshua Rifkin  a leading Joplin recording artist wrote A pervasive sense of lyricism infuses his work and even at his most highspirited he cannot repress a hint of melancholy or adversity  He had little in common with the fast and flashy school of ragtime that grew up after him[]  Joplin historian Bill Ryerson adds that In the hands of authentic practitioners like Joplin ragtime was a disciplined form capable of astonishing variety and subtlety  Joplin did for the rag whatChopin  did for themazurka  His style ranged from tones of torment to stunning serenades that incorporated thebolero  and the tango []  Biographer Susan Curtis wrote that Joplin s music had helped to revolutionise American music and culture by removing Victorian restraint[] Composer and actor Max Morath  found it striking that the vast majority of Joplin s work did not enjoy the popularity of theMaple Leaf Rag because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his lifetime[]  Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin opined thatMaple Leaf Rag would make him  King of Ragtime Composers  but he also knew that he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime  When I m dead twentyfive years people are going to recognize me  he told a friend Just over thirty years later he was recognized and later historian Rudi Blesh wrote a large book about ragtime which he dedicated to the memory of Joplin[] Although he was penniless and disappointed at the end of his life Joplin set the standard for ragtime compositions and played a key role in the development of ragtime music And as a pioneer composer and performer he helped pave the way for young black artists to reach American audiences of both races After his death jazz historian Floyd Levin noted Those few who realized his greatness bowed their heads in sorrow This was the passing of the king of all ragtime writers the man who gave America a genuine native music[] Revival[edit ]After his death in  Joplin s music and ragtime in general waned in popularity as new forms of musical styles such asjazz  and novelty piano  emerged Even so jazz bands and recording artists such asTommy Dorsey  in Jelly Roll Morton  in  and J Russell Robinson  in  released recordings of Joplin compositionsMaple Leaf Rag was the Joplin piece found most often on rpm  records[] In the s a smallscale reawakening of interest in classical ragtime was underway among some American music scholars such as Trebor TichenorWilliam Bolcom  William Albright  and Rudi Blesh  Audiophile Records  released a two record setThe Complete Piano Works of Scott Joplin The Greatest of Ragtime Composers performed by Knocky Parker  in [] In  Bolcom and Albright interested Joshua Rifkin  a young musicologist in the body of Joplin s work Together they hosted an occasional ragtimeandearlyjazz evening onWBAI  radio[]  In November  Rifkin released a recording calledScott Joplin Piano Rags []  on the classical  label Nonesuch  It sold  copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch s first millionselling record[]  The Billboard BestSelling Classical LPs chart for September   has the record at number  with the followup Volume  at number  and a combined set of both volumes at number  Separately both volumes had been on the chart for  weeks In the top  spots on that chart  of the entries were recordings of Joplin s work three of which were Rifkin s[]  Record stores found themselves for the first time putting ragtime in the classical music section The album was nominated in  for twoGrammy Award  categories Best Album Notes  and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance without orchestra  Rifkin was also under consideration for a third Grammy for a recording not related to Joplin but at the ceremony on March   Rifkin did not win in any category[]  He did a tour in  which included appearances on BBC  Television and a sellout concert at London sRoyal Festival Hall []  In Alan Rich  in the New York Magazine  wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin s music on diskNonesuch Records  created almost alone the Scott Joplin revival[] In January  Harold C Schonberg  music critic at the New York Times  having just heard the Rifkin album wrote a featured Sunday edition article entitled Scholars Get Busy on Scott Joplin[]  Schonberg s call to action has been described as the catalyst for classical music scholars the sort of people Joplin had battled all his life to conclude that Joplin was a genius[]  Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library  published a twovolume set of Joplin works in June  entitledThe Collected Works of Scott Joplin stimulating a wider interest in the performance of Joplin s musicIn midFebruary  under the direction of Gunther Schuller  The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble  recorded an album of Joplin s rags taken from the period collectionStandard HighClass Rags called Joplin The Red Back Book  The album won a Grammy Award  as Best Chamber Music Performance in that year and went on to becomeBillboard  magazine s Top Classical Album of []  The group subsequently recorded two more albums for Golden Crest RecordsMore Scott Joplin Rags in  and The Road From Rags To Jazz in In  film producer George Roy Hill  contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately asking each man to write the score for a film project he was working onThe Sting  Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments Instead Hill foundMarvin Hamlisch  available and brought him into the project as composer[]  Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin s music for theThe Sting for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation  on April  []  His version of The Entertainer reached number  on theBillboard Hot   and the American Top   music chart on May  [] []  prompting The New York Times  to write The whole nation has begun to take notice[]  Thanks to the film and its score Joplin s work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world becoming in the words of music magazineRecord World  the classical phenomenon of the decade[]  Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin s style and his band adaptations from Schuller s style[]  Schuller said Hamlisch got the Oscar for music he didn t write since it is by Joplin and

Grand Opera  The company toured briefly then settled into an eightweek run in New York on Broadway at thePalace Theater  in October and November This appearance was directed by Gunther Schuller and soprano Carmen Balthrop alternated withKathleen Battle  as the title character[]  An original Broadway cast recording was produced Because of the lack of national exposure given to the brief Morehouse College staging of the opera in  many Joplin scholars wrote that the Houston Grand Opera s  show was the first full production[]  saw the Royal Ballet  under director Kenneth MacMillan  create Elite

units who require prolonged care after an acute illness Predicting use of these facilities may help hospitals improve resource management expenditures and quality of care delivered in intensive careObjective To develop a predictive tool for early identification of intensive care patients with increased probability of transfer to such a hospitalMethods Data on  adults admitted to intensive care at a tertiary care hospital between January  and June  were retrospectively reviewed The prediction model was developed by using multiple ordinal logistic regression The model was internally validated via the bootstrapping technique and externally validated with a control cohort of  intensive care patientsResults Among the study group  patients  were discharged to longterm acute care hospitals and   to home or other care facilities   died in the intensive care unit The final prediction algorithm showed good accuracy biascorrected concordance index   CI  excellent calibration and external validation concordance index   CI  Hypoalbuminemia was the greatest potential driver of increased likelihood of discharge to a longterm acute care hospital Other important predictors were intensive care unit category older age extended hospital stay before admission to intensive care severe pressure ulcers admission source and dependency on mechanical ventilationConclusions This new predictive tool can help estimate on the first day of admission to intensive care the likelihood of a patients discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalThe economic impact of and demand for critical care services in the United States are intensifying From  to  annual critical care expenditures increased from  billion to  billion  In  critical care services accounted for approximately  of national health care expenditures and  of the US gross domestic product  Part of the increased costs and demand for intensive care unit ICU services are due to a subgroup of critically ill patients who survive acute illness and require prolonged lifesupport care   These patients also termed chronically critically ill represent a problem of growing importance Chronically critically ill patients account for only  to  of all ICU admissions but for approximately  of total ICU expenditures   The increasing costs and demand for critical care services in the United States have resulted in greater emphasis on efficient ICU resource management and improvement in quality of care    Development of care practices for chronically critically ill patients is a considerable challenge not only for ICU clinicians but also for the health system as a whole  Changes in reimbursement and the continued increase in the number of chronically critically ill patients have increased pressures on acute care hospitals to reduce the length of stay and cost of care  Longterm acute care hospitals LTACHs are facilities that have recently emerged in response to the demand for prolonged care after an acute illness  These facilities offer multiple benefits to patients and acute care hospitals including reduction of underreimbursed costs more efficient ICU bed procurement and improvement of benchmarking measurements     As a result the utilization and number of LTACHs have been increasing at a high rate Our primary objective in this study was to develop a predictive algorithm for early identification of ICU patients with a high probability of discharge to an LTACH We hypothesized that sufficient accuracy could be achieved by using predictor variables that were available within the first  hours of ICU admission Formerly no such predictive instrument has existed Although experienced ICU clinicians may use various clinical characteristics and laboratory results to estimate the future need for LTACH transfer this clinical assessment can be influenced by multiple biases  A predictive tool permits the clinical care team to make decisions based on and supported by objective data rather than subjective intuition Individualized prediction of discharge to an LTACH may allow for strategic planning to improve ICU resource management and quality of care In addition early and objective identification of ICU patients with the greatest likelihood of LTACH transfer could facilitate LTACH referrals encourage preparation of patients and their families and decrease financial issues for the patients and the hospitalsIncreased costs for ICU services come in part from the chronically critically illPrevious Section  Next Section  MethodsSample SelectionThis retrospective study was conducted at an academic tertiary care center with  adult ICU beds Approval was granted by the appropriate institutional review board informed consent was not required Data for development of the model were obtained from the medical records of  patients  years or older who had been admitted to an ICU between January  and June VariablesA team of clinicians and research staff developed a list of  demographic ICU admission and medical variables that they thought had empirical or theoretical relevance to discharge to an LTACH seeTable  Demographic variables included age sex and body mass index ICU admission was summarized by  variables length of stay before ICU admission source of admission ICU category and type of ICU admission Length of stay before ICU admission was defined as the number of days the patient stayed in the hospital directly before being admitted to the ICU Source of admission was the site from which the patient was transferred to the ICU  the emergency department  the hospital unit or operating room or  a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or an other hospital ICU category was defined as the admitting ICU cardiovascular coronary heart failure medical neurosurgical surgical Type of ICU admission indicated whether or not the admission was planned or anticipated by the care team ie discussed in notes before the admission or treatment intervention The remaining  physiological and laboratory variables were measures of medical status during the first  hours of ICU admission The response variable discharge disposition was collapsed into  categories LTACH home or other care facilities ie nonLTACH and death in the ICU Other care facilities encompassed skilled nursing facilities as well as acute and chronic rehabilitation facilitiesView this table   In this window    In a new window  Table Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis of model development cohortStatistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version  SAS Institute Inc and R statistical software version  R Foundation for Statistical Computing  Univariate analyses to compare the LTACH group with the nonLTACH and ICUdeath groups were performed by using the MannWhitney test Pearson  test or Fisher exact test as appropriate Differences were considered significant atP   With all  established variables see Table  a multiple ordinal logistic regression model was developed to predict the outcome of LTACH discharge A simultaneous approach ie all variables entered at a single step was implemented rather than a stepwise procedure for analysis as recommended by Harrell et al  Missing data in the development cohort were estimated by using themice multivariate imputation by chained equations function in R statistical software generating several imputations by using Gibbs sampling  The coefficients from the resulting multiple logistic regression model were used to construct a paperbased graphic calculation tool called a nomogram by using the design library of R statistical software Points for each predictor were determined by rescaling the regression coefficients to adapt to a userfriendly point scale Variable importance in the final model was ascertained from the relative potential contribution of points as deduced from the nomogram and the length of the axis Variables with longer axes have greater potential predictive effect in the modelInternal validation of the model with the original development data was determined by using the bootstrapping technique to correct for overfitting bias  During this process a random bootstrap sample of the original data was generated from the cohort and the model was applied to this sample to yield predicted results  This technique was repeated  times to obtain a biascorrected estimate of the models predictive accuracy Discrimination of the model was quantified by using the concordance index ie the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve The concordance index ranges from  random discrimination to  perfect discrimination and represents the ability of the model to accurately assign a higher probability to the patient discharged to LTACH for a randomly selected pair of patients with one discharged to LTACH and the other not Typically predictive tests are considered of clinical value when the concordance index is greater than    Calibration an additional measure of model performance illustrates how well the models predictions agree with the observed outcomes Calibration was assessed graphically by plotting predicted vs actual probabilities for discharge to LTACH A model with perfect predictions generates a calibration curve that lies on the  lineTwentyone variables that had empirical or theoretical relevance to longterm acute care were usedThe predictive tool was externally validated with an independent cohort of  ICU patients at the same institution admitted between January  and March  The sample size of the validation cohort was estimated to provide greater than  statistical power to conclude a concordance index of the validation data set assumed to be approximately  on the basis of the data for the development cohort is significantly greater than  Discrimination of the model on the external validation sample was quantified with the concordance index and calibration was assessed graphicallyUsing the nomogram Figure   to calculate the predicted probability of LTACH discharge requires the following steps  locate the patients category or value on the axis corresponding to the respective predictor variable  draw a vertical line upward to the points axis to determine how many points are assigned for that characteristic in the model  repeat this process for the remaining predictor variable axes determining the points for each predictor independently  sum the points achieved for all predictors  locate this summed point value on the total points axis and draw a vertical line down to the probability axis to calculate the patients predicted probability of having the models primary end point ie discharge to an LTACH  View larger version   In this window    In a new window  Figure  Nomogram for discharge to a longterm

were discharged home or to other care facilities   died in the ICU The median ICU length of stay for patients transferred to an LTACH was  days thth percentile [interquartile range]  days Conversely patients discharged home or to other care facilities had a median ICU length of stay of  days interquartile range  days P   and patients who died in the ICU had a median ICU length of stay of  days

hypoalbuminemia ie serum level of albumin  gdL is potentially the most influential predictor of increased likelihood of discharge to an LTACH ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU particularly

extreme values of PaO serum levels of creatinine or total bilirubin or platelet count contribute any meaningful amounts to the predicted risk Sex and requirements for dopamine dobutamine and epinephrine during the first  hours of ICU admission have minor impacts on the prediction of discharge to an LTACH ie contributed a relatively small number of points to the nomogram total score

validation data setPrevious Section  Next Section  DiscussionWe used demographic ICU admission and ICU clinical data measured during the first  hours of ICU admission to construct and validate a predictive model for estimating future use of an LTACH The models discrimination and calibration in the development and validation cohorts indicate it makes it possible to accurately predict the likelihood of LTACH use among ICU patients The most potentially influential determinants of this outcome included hypoalbuminemia ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU older age extended hospital length of stay before ICU admission presence of severe pressure ulcers ICU admission from a skilled nursing facility an LTACH or another hospital and early requirement for mechanical ventilation These findings confirm and extend those of previous investigations   which have shown that in addition to dependency on mechanical ventilation older age and greater severity of illness other considerations are important for assessing disposition of discharge from an ICUThe model shows a strong direct association between hypoalbuminemia and the likelihood of discharge to an LTACH This finding may be explained by the underlying nutritional status hepatic failure cirrhosis andor acute response to stress or sepsis among critically ill patients   Several studies   have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased mortality morbidity ICU length of stay and resource utilization in critically ill patients Scheinhorn et al  found that hypoalbuminemia was common among patients admitted to an LTACH and previous investigators   emphasized its importance in predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation and chronic critical illness ICU categories other than cardiovascular ICU contribute substantial points to the models predicted risk for discharge to an LTACH This result most likely occurs because these noncardiovascular ICUs typically receive more unplanned critically ill ICU patients than does a cardiovascular ICU A majority of cardiovascular ICU admissions  in a cardiovascular ICU vs  in all other ICUs are planned temporary eg  hours ICU transfers immediately after surgery as a monitoring precaution before the patient is moved to a stepdown unit Finally the predictive value of deepwound pressure ulceration within the LTACH discharge model is supported by the results of other investigations    The frequency of pressure ulcers in critically ill patients is a result of multiple comorbid conditions inability to move impaired angiogenesis response and dependency on mechanical ventilation  Our results suggest that stage  or higher pressure ulcers early in the ICU admission are associated with a higher likelihood of discharge to an LTACHOur findings are especially relevant because of the current initiatives to improve care practices for patients who are chronically critically ill      Early identification of LTACH use may allow clinical care teams to make appropriate arrangements for patients care after discharge from the ICU improve the transition of care ensure bed availability and avoid potential delays in patients discharge As emphasized by Zimmerman et al  discharge planning started shortly after ICU admission allows for more efficient use of ICU resources Enhanced ICU bed utilization has a variety of clinical implications including potentially better outcomes and farreaching financial value Older age presence of severe pressure ulcers early mechanical ventilation are also predictors of discharge to a longterm acute care hospitalLTACHs may improve outcomes for chronically critically ill patients through specialized care These hospitals often embrace a multidisciplinary and rehabilitationbased approach to treatment providing a setting with experienced health professionals and ample clinical resources for the care of patients who are chronically critically ill     Votto et al  reported that the clinical outcomes including inhospital mortality and discharges to home were significantly better for patients transferred to an LTACH than for similar patients who remained in acute care hospitals Furthermore patients treated at an LTACH are less likely to be readmitted to an acute care hospital than are those treated in alternative care settings after discharge from an ICU In addition to potential clinical benefits financial advantages may exist that support the use of LTACHs for chronically critically ill patients Cost reduction by LTACHs has been achieved by focusing on efficient staff operation and incorporation of care protocols as well as service and resource standardization  Votto et al  compared costs between LTACHeligible patients transferred and not transferred to an LTACH and concluded that the mean total cost per patient at an LTACH   was less than that at an acute care hospital  In a study  of critically ill patients with tracheostomies total Medicare expenses related to the admission ie acute and postacute care were less for patients in an LTACH than for patients in other settings Conversely results of a study  examining Medicare claims for a variety of patient types indicated that although patients transferred to an LTACH had decreased costs in the acute setting their total cost of care was higher than that of patients discharged to other postacute care facilities eg skilled nursing facility rehabilitation facility Although evidence     indicates that LTACH utilization results in considerable cost savings for acute care hospitals the economic impact of LTACH facilities on US health care expenditures is still undeterminedUnfortunately evidence is lacking on the effectiveness of LTACH utilization to treat patients with longterm illnesses The current interpretation is primarily based on retrospective studies which may introduce multiple biases The economic impact of LTACH utilization and whether these facilities actually help improve the longterm outcomes of chronically critically ill patients must be properly evaluated If compelling evidence supports therapeutic benefits of LTACH usage implementation of interventions designed to discharge chronically critically ill patients to an LTACH would be a safe approach to providing critical care services in a costeffective wayOur study has some notable limitations Our development and validation cohorts were patients admitted to a single tertiary care institution a situation that may limit the applicability of the results In addition the retrospective design may have introduced ascertainment bias The study design also restricted our analysis to data contained within the electronic health records preventing us from including other factors known to influence LTACH utilization such as payer source patient and clinician preference LTACH discharge criteria bed availability and geographic limitations  Previous Section  Next Section  ConclusionsThis study was our first effort at developing a clinical instrument to predict early in a patients ICU admission the probability of that patients discharge to an LTACH We think that this predictive tool offers a valuable perspective for patients patients family members clinicians and hospitals When complemented by the clinicians judgment as well as feedback from patients and their family members this risk calculator has the potential to improve the quality of care delivered to chronically critically ill patients while enhancing ICU resource managementPrevious Section  Next
